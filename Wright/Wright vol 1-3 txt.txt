Paper, 10|^ in. by 6|, consisting of 263 
leaves, some of which are much torn, espe- 
ciaUy foU. 1, 2, 8, 10, 23, 24, 26, 115, 262, 
and 263. The quires, signed with letters, 
were originally 30 in number ; but of these 
the first (with the exception of a single leaf), 
the second, and the last, are now missing. 
Leaves are also wanting after foil. 2, 8, 22, 
23, and 260. There are from 21 to 27 lines 
in each page. This volume is written in a 
good, regular hand of the xiii*^ cent. Some 
Syriac vowels have been added by the scribe, 
and other hands have inserted numerous 
Greek vowels, as well as the points rukkdkh 
and ktMhshdiy both in red and black ink. It 
contains —

version ; viz.

are : ch. i. 1 — iv. 12, v. 11 — ^xvii. 10, xviii. 
6 — 27, xxiii. 8 — ^xxiv. 11, xxxi. 53 — xxxvi.

Deuteronomy (sections not marked 
throughout). Pol. 212 a. The missing por- 
tions are : ch. xxx. 1 — 20, and xxxii. 14— 
xxxiv. 12. 

A few lessons (rdi*Ho) have been marked 
on the margins ; e.g. foil. 40 J, 41 J, and 44 b. 
There are also many marginal notes and 
glosses, chiefly in Arabic, by different hands. 

[Add. 14,671.] 

III. 

Vellum, 10| in. by 8^, consisting of 230 
leaves, many of which, especially in the first 
half of the volume, are much stained and 
slightly mutilated. It seems to have origi-* 
nally consisted of 24 quires, signed with 
letters (see fol. 61, \ ; fol. 71, *» ; fol. 100, 
Kl* ; fol. 110, »au ; fol. 161, u ; etc.) Leaves 
are now wanting after foil. 2, 89, 119, and 
230. Each page is divided into two columns, 
of from 24 to 31 lines. This volume appears 
to have been the work of two scribes, the 
one of whom wrote from the beginning to 
fol. 115, the other from fol. 116 to the end. 
It was written at Amid, in the year of the 
Greeks 775, A.D. 464. The character in 
both parts is a fine, bold Estrangela. Vowels 
have sometimes been added by a later hand 
(>., p, w/^, X, XTr w"f"KA^ ). Poll. 1 — 6, 9, and 
19, have been inserted, to replace lost leaves, 
apparently about the viii*^ cent. Pol. 10 is 
of still later date. The contents are — 

Pour books of the Pentateuch, according 
to the Peshitta version ; viz.

Deut. xxxiv. 2 to the end. 

As this is believed to be the oldest dated 
manuscript of any portion of the Bible now 
extant, it may be worth while to give a 
collation of some portions of the text with

The quires, six in number, are signed with 
iettOTS, There are from 22 to 33 lines in 
each page. It is made up of parts of two 
manuscripts, the one of the ix*^ or x*^ cent., 
the other of the x*^ or xi*^ cent. The former, 
foil. 136 — 164, is written- in a good, regular 
hand, with many Syriac vowel-points and 
accents, and is apparently of Nestorian 
origin. The latter ia in an ordinary current 
hand, and rather carelessly written. The 
contents are — *:,

A note in the same handwriting, on fol. 
108 a, states that the manuscript was written 
for the monks of the convent of Natpha,* 
near Maridin, at the expense of the priest 
Julian kLaioi, and of the deacons George 
and Bada, visitors (K'laauto, ^epMSein^) of 
the said convent, re:^^^^ a:uauk.o o\^^M^h\x<

of Moses of Nisibis, abbat of the convent of 
S. Mary Deipara in the desert of Scete 
(A. Gr. 1243, A.D. 932),t that this book 
was procured by him for the library of the

Vellum, about 9J in. by 6, consisting of 
14 leaves (Add. 14,444, foil. 25—38), several 
of which are much stained and torn, espe- 
cially foil. 33 — 38. The quires are signed 
with letters (fol. 27, ^), but not a single 
one is complete. Each page is divided into 
two columns, of from 32 to 34 lines. The 
\\Titing is a fine, regular Estrangela of the

XI. 

Vellum, about 9^ in. by 6^, consisting of 
89 leaves, the last of which is much torn. 
The quires, originally ten in number, are 
signed with letters ; but of the first only a 
single leaf remains. Each page has from 20 
to 22 lines. This manuscript is written in 
a beautiful, regular Estrangela, by the dea- 
con Saba of Eas'ain, about A.D. 724. It 
contains — 

The book of Numbers, according to the 
Peshitta version, commencing with ch. iii. 14. 
Subscription, fol. 89 a : i^v^^ r^juuso ^Jlsl 

The subscription is followed by a dox- 
ology : . Aa ^ ^.*u\Qo vykcuAiA^ f<V»naT, 

After this we read in smaller letters: 

o^o /Klico KLa^LA •siiu&.i f^il 1 \ T ■! 

"Jesus God, have mercy on Saba the 
scribe of B/as'ain, who wrote this book, and 
did not write in it a blotted tau.^* See Add. 
12,186, part first, and Add. 14,430, where 
we have the dates A.D. 726 and 724. 

On fol. 89 b there are two notes in a small 
and neat hand, but much stained, so that 
a few words are barely legible. The first 
runs as follows.

" Our Lord Jesus the Messiah, have mercy 
on the feeble, sinful and miserable (man), 
who has need of the mercy of God, Rubil 
(Reuben) the sinful deacon, who read this 
Testament with his master Mar Abraham 
Hahunaya (?) ;♦ and they inserted (words) in 
it, and restored (injured passages) in it, and 
made erasures from it ; but this they did only 
where it was proper. Lord, give a blessing, 
that every one who reads in these books may 
pray for Kubil the sinner, who sewed, and 
read, and renovated, and for Abraham his 
master abundantly and especially, (saying :) 
May my prayer intercede for them. Amen. 
Written by the scribe Ram-id (?), may God 
pardon him." 

The second note reads thus —

the heard and accepted prayers of the Mother 
of God the Virgin Mary, on account of his 
care of this church. And may every one," etc. 

On the margin of fol. 89 a we read in a

On fol. 60 a there is a long note, stating 
that this manuscript was written in the year 
910, and collated with another copy of the 
school of the Armenians. The names of the 
man at whose expense it was transcribed, 
and of the convent to which he gave it, were 
altered by the hand of a person from the 
village of Kephar-Darin, who added a few 
lines, informing us that the manuscript was 
incorporated with the library of the convent 
of Mar Daniel at Kephar-Bil audoaak.! (P), 
near Antioch, when Thomas was abbat, the 
priest Simeon his deputy, and the priest 
Moses librarian. The name of this man has 
in turn been erased by one Tazdin bar 
Duma (?).

A modem hand (perhaps the same that 
added the vowels) has marked the lessons on 
the margins, and also appended a few notes, 
either referring to the text of the LXX.,

Leaves are wanting after foil. 3 and 109- 
Each page has from 20 to 25 lines. This 
volume is written in a fine, regular Estran-

This manuscript seems, asi stated above, to 
be of the xii*** cent. However, on fol. 165 6, 
at the end of the Lamentations of Jeremiah, 
there is added, in a much later hand, the 
date A. Gr. 1097, A.D. 786 (!) : ^r< W

been Bar-sauma. At least, on the lower 
margin of fol. 39 a, there is written in the 
same ink as the text :

XXXIV. 

Vellum, about 8^ in. by 5f , consisting of 
122 leaves, some of which are slightly stained 
and torn, especially foil. 1 — 5 and 122. The 
quires, 15 in number, seem origroally to 
have been left imsigned; they are now 
signed with letters, in one or two instances 
incorrectly. Each page has from 19 to 22 
lines. The writing is a fine, regular Estran- 
gela of the vi*^ cent. A few Greek vowels 
have been subsequently added (y w h ^ x). 
This manuscript contains — 

The book of Isaiah, t^AauLrt".! co^cuaji, ac- 
cording to the Peshitta version. Eol. 3 b. 
Some lessons are indicated by rubrics in the 
text, and many more have been added on 
the margins by a later hand, which has often 
altered the original rubrics. An index to 
these lessons is prefixed to the book, fol. 1 J, 
with the title : f^^ai t^AauLrt".! r^x»HA •x.ioi^ 

What originally stood after the doxology, 
fol. 122 fl, has been erased, in order to make 
room for a note in a modern hand. Of this 
latter only a few words are now legible, 
owing to the lower part of the leaf being 
torn away, but it evidently contained the 



name of a possessor of the volume : >cDo^f^ 
. . . [f^jauau [f^]:uLf^9 rdico r€nhck 

On fol. 122 b there is a note of older date, 
probably of the x*^ cent., stating that the 
manuscript belonged to Leontius, abbat of 
the convent of Max Theodbre on the moun- 
tain to the west of Sarin, who, with his 
disciple Constantine, purchased it for the 
use of the convent: ftlaS^ f^i&o.i i^ooai

The above note is in the handwriting of 
one Simeon the son of cu^ , the same who 
drew up the index of lessons, as may be seen 
from the note appended to that index, fol. 3 a :

The large writing that once covered fol. 1 a 
has been partially efiaced, and over it there 
is now written a prayer of Jacob of Batnae, 
^nn\>iaw.i K'^oa^, beginning: r^L^i^ >o 

The leaf, or rather scrap of veUum, num- 
bered fol. 121, does not belong to this volume, 
but contains Jeremiah, ch. i. 5 — 8, ch. ix. 
23, 24, etc., written in a comparatively 
modern hand, with many abbreviations.

torn, containing Isaiah, ch. xxxvii. 30 —

lines, in a good, regular Estrangela of the 
vii*^ cent.

XXXVI. 

Vellum, about llj in. by 8|, consisting of 
130 leaves, a few of which are much stained 
and torn, especiaUy foil. 1, 10, 127 and 130. 
The quires are 14 in number, the last being 
imperfect, and are now signed with letters. 
Each page is divided into two columns, of 
from 21 to 24 lines. The writing is an ele- 
gant Estrangela of the vi*^ cent. Greek 
vowels have been not unfrequently added 

by a later hand ( ^, ^, h^ ^ ; S9 e.g. «^soa»ieLD ^ , 

but also o( and jt ; i^, e.g. rt'iAioT) ; the 
points rukhakh and kuahshdi very rarely 
(e.g. fol. 98 a). This manuscript contains — 

1. The book of Jeremiah, co^cu-aj

f^jLsnhf^^i cD^iAcirt', fol. 108 a, and the Prayer

The second epistle, ending with ch. v. 2. 
Fol. 121 *. Title : ^iii^ i^iiiVr^. 

Of the lessons, some are rubricated in the 
text, whilst others have been noted on the 
margins by different hands. The same reader 
who added the vowels has divided the Pro- 
phecies into 33 sections (fol. 102 by «^^). 

There are a very few marginal notes in 
Arabic; e.g. fol. 12 a, w^ina\ nrt^, marg. 

{jo»sS\ ((^^ooaJI); fol. 44 hy ^ordss^ rtUi^a, 
mzxQ. yjfi^ jX>S {J}y}^ jxxi). On fol. 18 a, at 
the foot of the page, the Syriac word i^co^ 
is represented in Greek letters by ceyXoi. 

On fol. 1 a there is a note stating that this 
book belonged to the brothers Matthew, 
Abraham and Theodore of Tagrit: tcooiurt'

Above this is written in cursive Greek 
characters the single word epefuaa. 

Pol. 130 does not, apparently, belong to 
this volume. It contains, on the recto, two 
notes, the one stating that a certain book 
belonged to the convent of S. Mary Deipara, 
the other that it was brought thither by the 
abbat Moses of Nisibis. The latter, so far 
as it is legible, runs as follows :

On foil. 1 J, 2 a, 69, and 70, there are 
hymns and prayers, rather rudely written, 
and now so much stained and effaced as to 
be read in some places with difficulty.

bound up a collection of Demonstrations 
from the Fathers, for on the margin of fol.

100 leaves, of which foil. 1, 29, 30, and 100, 
are more or less mutilated. The quires, 
originally 13 in number, are signed with 
letters. Leaves are wanting after foil. 28, 
29, 30, and 38. Each page has from 23 to 
25 lines. The writing is a fine, regular 
Estrangela of the vii*^ cent. Vowels have 
occasionally been added in faint characters 
by a later hand. This manuscript contains — 

The book of Ezekiel, A*rtl4DU>.i cp^cuaji , 
according to the Peshitta version. A later 
hand has indicated a marginal division into 
24 sections (^=kUm»-). The following por- 
tions of the text are missing: ch. xiv. 14 — 
xvi. 17, xvi. 32 — 53, xvii. 3 — xxii. 2, and 
xxiv. 18 — XXV. 3. The lessons are rubri- 
cated in the text, the end of each being 
usually indicated by the letter jl (>\*.). To 
these there is an index on fol. 1 a. •x.ioi^

for thee at the commencement of each quire, 



that thou mayest find without delay the 
lesson which thou seekest among those 
written above." By i^^a is meant a single 
leaf of the manuscript. 

On fol. 100 b is the colophon: ^.^mA r. 

followed by the usual doxology, and by two 
lines of writing in a mope cursive character, 
which are now only partially legible, but 
may be supplied as follows: K'io^ ^a A& 

Under this, there is a note in a much later 
hand, part of which is torn away and the 
rest almost obliterated. The words tcoo^K", 
f^^Aa, and ^oiu, are still legible, from 
which it is evident that it contained one of 
the customary anathemas. 

At the foot of foil. 86 6, 93 d, and 99 6, 
there are drawings, of a later date than the 
manuscript, representing a peacock, and 
birds feeding their young in the nest. 

According to the note on fol. 1 i, >ijsn.i

**1?he manuscript, according to which 
the book in hands was translated from 
Greek into Syriac, was taken from a copy 
of the Hexapla among those in the library 
of Csesarea in Palestine, collated with that 
exemplar in which was written as follows : 
' I Eusebius have corrected carefully to the 
best of my ability/ The translation from 
the Greek tongue into the Syriac was made 
in the month of Shebat, A. Gr. 927 (A.D, 
616), fourth indiction, at the Enaton* of 
Alexandria, in the holy convent of the 
Antonine monks." 

On fol. 122 b there is a note, in the hand- 
writing of the scribe, but in a more cursive 
character, stating that this manuscript be- 
longed to the convent of Mar Cyriacus at 
Telia Haphikha (see Add. 17,103) : tcooiuK'

On the margin is recorded, at a still later 
period, the name of a reader called John : 

The two leaves numbered 123 and 124 did 
not originally form part of this manuscript^ 
but were added to it, as fly-leaves, when it was 
last bound in the convent. They belong, to all 
appearance, to one and the same book, but 
are both very much soiled and torn. What 
is legible on fol. 124 b refers to the first and 
second days of the Creation. Fol. 123 was 
the last leaf of the book, containing on the 
recto a note, giving the date and the name 
of the scribe Eomanus :

Vellum, about 10 in. by 6|, consisting of 79 
leaves, many of which are much stained and 
torn, especially foil. 1, 5, 6, 8—14, 17, 27, 48, 
51, 52, 55, 65, 67, 70—72, 75, and 76. The 
quires, 20 in number, are signed with letters, 
but not more than two or three of them are 
complete, leaves being missing at the begin- 
ning and end, as well as after foil. 2, 3, 4, 7, 
9, 10, 11, 15, 28, 29, 30, 41, 50, 54, 55, 56, 
58, 69, 71, 74, 75, 77 and 78. Each page 
has from 22 to 27 lines. The writing is 
a fine, regular Estrangela of the first half 
of the viii^^ cent. This manuscript con-

be of considerably later date than the manu- 
script itself, though probably anterior to the 
xii*^ cent. 

On the margin of fol. 79 b there is a note, 
in a hand of the xii*^ or xiii*** cent., stating 
that the book was repaired and bound by the 
scribe Yeshua' : • r^ao^ •^l.oz* m.io ii.TM

are missing at the beginning, as well as 
after foU. 81, 89, 97, 116 and 126. Each

days of Shebat were passed; in the year

this manuscript was written for a monk 
named Theodore (the name is almost com- 
pletely erased), in the monastery of Natpha, 
situated above the monastery of Hananya 
or Ananias, to the east of the city of Maridin, 
in the year 1545 (A.D. 1234), when Igna-

On fol. 68 a there is a note, written by 
Gregory, metropolitan of Jerusalem, A. Gr. 
1827 (A.D. 1516), forbidding any one to 
take away this New Testament from the 
convent of S. Mary of Deipara. He wrote 
it, as well as similar notes in other volumes, 
at the request of Severus, the abbat of the 
convent, who is stated to have been a liberal 
donor to its library.

recent signatures (letters) are not always 
correct. Each page is divided into two 
columns, of from 22 to 27 lines. The 
character is a large, regular Estrangela of 
the v*^ or vi*^ cent. Fol. 173 has been re- 
paired with paper, about the xii*^ cent. This 
manuscript contains — 

The four Gospels, according to the Peshitta 
version; viz. 

S. Matthew, fol. 1 a ; beginning with ch. 
vi. 25. 

S. Mark. Fol. 49 h. 

S. Luke. Fol. 85 b. 

S. John, fol. 142 b ; ending with ch. xx. 25. 

The lessons are indicated on the margins 
by several hands, none of them so old as the 
text. 

The larger sections have been marked by 
two hands. The more ancient employs the 
letter^ (i.e. f^.»iL*»^), with or without another 
letter prefixed, e.g. -f<^y3, etc.,^,jjA,^, 
etc., up to -ii; the other uses the ordinary 
method of numeration. They seem, however, 
to disagree in all the Gtospels, except that of 
S. Matthew.

LXVII. 

Vellum, about 14f in. by llf, consisting

stained and torn, especially foil. 5, 9, 10, 
49, 56, 59, 60, 62, 68, 100, 134 and 135. 
Owing to the imperfect condition of the 
volume, the number of quires cannot be 
accurately stated; nor does it appear how 
they were originally signed. At present, 
the last signature is »aX (fol. 125 a). Leaves 
are wanting at the beginning and end, as 
well as after foil. 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 49, 52, 
65, 68, 70, 81, 84, 87, 99, 101, 133 and 
134. Each page is divided into two columns, 
of from 15 to 21 lines. The writing is a 
large, beautiful Estrangela of the vi*^ cent. 
This manuscript contains —

viii. 29—39, ix. 14—36, x. 12—17, xii. 25— 
46, xiii. 19 — xiv. 16, xv. 4 — xvi. 5, xix. 23 — 
xxii. 24, xxii. 58 — ^xxiii. 35, and xxiv. 17 — 29. 

S. John. Fol. 90 a. Missing portions : ch- 
iv. 10—23, iv. 47— V. 5, xii. 36—49, and 
xiii. 9 to the end, with the exception of a 
few words from ch. xix. 41 and ch. xx. 2, 4, 
7, 8 (fol. 135). 

The Ammonian sections and Eusebian 
canons are marked in the text with red ink, 

e.g. fol. 1 a, ^, ^^ ; and at the foot of each 

page there is a harmony of the Gospels ; e.g. 
fol. 1 a :

stained and soiled, and a few slightly torn, 
especially foil. 1, 12, 183, and 200. The 
quires, 20 in number, are signed with both

numbered them with letters, and placed 
Coptic ciphers at the top of the first and last

into two columns, of from 26 to 31 lines. 
This volume is written in a fine Estrangela 
of the vi*^ or vii* cent., except foil. 199 and

the rubrics being occasionally placed in the 
text, but more commonly on the upper 
margin. A great many have been noted by 
several later hands, one of them in Arabic 
(fol. 121 b). A modem hand has divided the

which are of the viii*^ cent.,* and fol. 58, 
which is a modem addition and palimpsest. 
Later hands have added Syriao vowels and 
diacritical points, abundantly in the first 22 
leaves, more sparingly in the rest of the

is a harmony at the foot of each page. The 
larger sections have been noted on the mar- 
gins in black by a modem hand ; and in the 
second part, foil. 23 — 152, there is also a 
marginal division into sections by an old 
Greek hand. The large red Syriac letters 
on the margins of the second part (e.g. 
fol. 29 a, oa.; fol. 30 6, A ; fol. 31 J, va.; 
fol. 34 6, j^; fol. 37 a, aa»; fol. 48 a, *»;

the usual way, with a solitary exception on 
the margin of fol. 18 h.

fol. 80); but a later hand has employed 
the letters of the alphabet for this purpose. 
Each page is divided into two columns, of 
from 22 to 25 lines. The writing is a fine 
Estrangela of the vi*^ or vii**' cent. Vowels 
have been added in the first 61 leaves by a 
much later hand (>.,<, h, p, *, or +). The 
contents are — 

The four Gospels, according to the Pe-

fol. 177 b. 

The lessons are indicated by ^ on the

top of the column, and jl at the end. Many 
have been noted by two later hands, one 
of which has introduced a marginal division 
of the Gospels into sections. Of these there 
are 22 in S. Matthew, 13 in S. Mark, 23 in 
S. Luke, and 6 in the remaining portion

by 8, written in double columns, in a rude 
Estrangela, by one Samuel (bar Cyriacus), 
a recluse of Gozarta (r^Aiiia^^) in Egypt, 
towards the end of the xi*"^ cent. The con- 
tents are — 

The Gospel of S. Matthew, ch. x. 10—26. 

The Gospel of S. John, ch. vii. 2 — x. 3 ; 
ch. xix. 29 — xxi. 12. 

The text exhibits the Ammonian sections, 
each being referred to the proper canon of 
Eusebius. The lessons are indicated in the

"Samuel, a stranger, known as the re- 
cluse in Gozarta, in Egypt, collected and 
bound this holy book. And I collected it 
from Egypt. And it belongs to the convent 
of the Mother of God, which is in the desert 
of Abba Macarius ;'* etc. 

In the binding of this volume there have 
been preserved, though in a mutilated con- 
dition, two very ancient Arabic documents. 
The one, fol. 1 a, written in an almost 
Kufic character, is a patent of manumission 
(»| j), granted by the amir Ahmad ibn Tulun 
to Ahmad ibn Kara (U), and therefore 
dating from between A.H. 260 and 270, 
A.D. 864 aod 883. The other, fol. 214 J, 
written in a current naskhi, appears to be 
a statement of the amoimt of tax due by 
certain places or communities in Egypt for 



the years 294 and 296 of the Hijra, dated 
A.H. 296, A.D. 909.

Under this there stands a note, partially 
effaced and torn, which states that the 
volume was written at Tel-Dinawar in the 
district of Beth-Nuhadra,* A. Gr. 911, A.D. 
600, in the tenth year of the reign of 
Khusrau (Parwiz, Chosroes II., A.D. 591 — 
628) • Prom this note we learn too that 
there was a Nestorian school or college at 
Dinawar.

The more modem writing on fol. 1 a seems, 
so far as it is legible, to be part of a hymn or 
prayer. That on fol. 106 ft is a statement of 
the number of r<l»\^ or versicles in the 
four Gospels. [Add. 14,460.]

LXXVII. 

Vellum, about 8J in. by 5f , consisting of 
108 leaves, some of which are slightly stained 
and torn, especially foil. 1 — 3, 23, 103, and 
108. The quires, 11 in number, are signed 
with letters. Each page has from 30 to 38 
lines, only the last four being divided into 
columns. The writing is a clear, regular, 
Nestorian Estrangela, with numerous Syriac 
vowel -points and marks of punctuation, 
accents, etc., mostly added, it would appear, 
by later hands. This manuscript is dated 
A.D. 616, and contains — • 

The four Gospels, according to the Peshitta 
version; viz. 

S. Matthew. Fol. 1 b. 

S. Mark. Fol. 32 b. 

S. Luke. Fol. 62 a. 

S.John. Fol. 86 S. 

The larger sections are regularly marked 
on the margins, where a few lessons have 
also been indicated by more modem hands. 
There is some attempt made at ornamenting 
the running titles, signatures, etc. 

The second column of fol. 108 a contains 
a note, which states that the volume was 
written in the twenty-fifth year of the reign 
of Khusrau the son of Hurmuz, king of 
Persia (i.e. A. Gr. 926, A.D. 615), when 
Mar Basha was metropolitan of Nisibis, Mar 
Matthew head of the college, Mar Aha 
lecturer, and Mar Bar-Sahde teacher. It 
belonged to, and was collated by, Gabriel 
Katraya (or the Bactrian).

The note that originally stood on foL 1 a

salem, and to Abu '1-Husain his brother, 
that they may pray for her (me), and make 
mention of me in their prayers, and for her 
(my) deceased in the faith." 

On fol. 108 b there is a list of the asso- 
ciates of the Apostles, such as Barnabas, 
Sosthenes, Nathaniel, Justus, Silas, Bufus, 
Alexander, etc. ; but some of the names are 
scarcely legible. [Add. 14,471.] 

Lxxvin. 

Vellum, about 9f in. by 6|, consisting 
of 139 leaves, some of which are slightly 
stained and torn, especially foil. 58, 119, 
and 120. Foil, 75 — 84 have been the- 
roughly soaked in oil. The quires, signed 
with letters, were originally 17 in number, 
of which ^s and u are now lost. Leaves are 
also wanting at the beginning, and after 



foU. 20 and 21. Each page is divided into 
two columns, of from 24 to 31 lines. The 
writing is a good, regular Estrangela of the 
vii*** cent.; many Greek vowels (^, c, h, />, 
*, w) have been added, in the first half, by a 
later hand« This manuscript contains — 

The four (Gospels, according to the Pgshi^ta 
version; viz. 

S.Matthew. Fol. la. The missing portions 
are : ch. i. 1 — ^16, xiv. 33 — xv. 24, and xvi. 8 
— xix. 8. 

S. Mark. Fol. 40 a. 
S. Luke. Fol. 69 a. 

S. John. Fol. 120 a. Missing portions : 
ch. i. 1 — ^vi. 20, and xvi. 8 to the end. 

The Ammonian sections and Eusebian 
canons are marked in the usual way, and 
there is a harmony at the foot of each page. 

The larger sections have been noted be- 
tween the columns by a later hand, and 
another marginal division, by means of 
Greek letters, is carried through part of 
the volume. Of these latter sections there 
are 72 (OB) in 8. Matthew ; but in S. Mark 
the numeration seems to stop with KT (fol. 
63 ft), and in S. Luke with 6 (fol. 73 ft), 
whilst in S. John it does not appear at all. 

Some of the lessons are rubricated in the 
text, and others have been added by later 
hands on the margins. 

The same person, apparently, who added 
the Greek vowels, has inserted, chiefly in 
the Gospel of S. Matthew, some various 
readings from the Harklensian version 
(rdAovi, abbreviated ^v» and v»), e.g. foil. 
5 a and 6, 7 ft, 12 a, 17 a, 19 a and ft, 22 ft, 23 «, 
24 ft, etc. ; more rarely from other sources 
(rdiVif^or ftlAv.!^), e.g. foil. 26 ft, 32 6, 33 ft, 
35 ft, etc. Occasional attempts have been 
made to represent Syriac words by Greek 

letters; e.g. fol. 18 ft, f<Li4», MACA; 

fol, 30 a, ,,jv^\\Ji, NATG; fol. 31 a, kU»oi,

Vellum, about 12^ in. by 9f , consisting of 
195 leaves, some of which are much stained 
and torn, especially foil, 1 — 9, 14, 18, 29 
and 30. The quires are 23 in number, but 
f^ and ^a are very imperfect. They were 
signed with both arithmetical figures and 

letters (e. g. fol. 9 a, ^^ ; fol. 31 a, Ci 

fol. 41 a, ^; fol. 121 a, ^); but have 

been since renumbered with Syriac letters, 
and also with Coptic arithmetical figures 
(commencing with fol. 191 a). Leaves are 
wanting at the beginning, as well as after 
foU. 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 12, 17, 26, 27 and 28. 
Each page is divided into two columns, of 
from 21 to 24 lines. The writing is a fine, 
regular Estrangela of the vii*^ cent. Toll. 
18 — 30 are part of another codex of about 
the same age ; and fol. 14 is an addition of 
considerably later date and palimpsest. The 
volume contains — 

The four Gospels, according to the Pe- 
shitta version ; viz. 

8. Matthew, fol. 3 a, commencing with 
ch. ii. V. 5. The following portions of the 
text are likewise wanting : ch. ii. 16 — ^v. 20, 
vi. 3 — X. 22 (with the exception of a few 
words on foil. 6 and 7), xii. 43 — xiii. 28, 
xix. 23 — ^xxi. 9, xxi. 25 — ^xxii. 37, and xxiii. 
14 — ^xxiv. 11.

The Ammonian sections and Eusebian 
canons are marked in the text with red ink, 
and there is a harmony at the foot of each 
page (except foil. 18 — 30). The Eusebian 
canons (and doubtless the Epistle to Car- 
pianus) were originally prefixed to the 
volume, for foil. 1 and 2 contain can. v — 
viii., arranged in columns, with ornamented 
capitals, etc. 

Of the lessons some are rubricated in the 
text, but many more have been noted on 
the margins by later hands, Syriac and 
Greek (see, for example, foil. 10 a, 13 J, 
35 by 43 a, 74 a, 106 J, 108 a and ft, 122 a, 
123 a and i, 126 a, 175 a and i, etc.). The 
beginning and end of each lesson are marked 
in Syriac by ^ and jl, in Greek by ap (apxn) 
and T^ (t€Xo9). 

Pol. 14 is a palimpsest leaf, containing 
S. Matthew, ch. xxvi. 48 — 64, elegantly 
written in the Palestinian character, and 
perhaps of not much later date than the 
rest of the volume. On the verso there is 
an ornament at the top and the figure of a 
fish on the lower margin. 

On the margin of fol. 156 a a reader called 
John has recorded his name : r^xnj^ i^Jr^

A more modem hand has indicated the 
usual larger sections on the margin, yiz. 22 
in S. Matthew, 13 in S. Mark, 23 in 8. Luke, 
and 20 in S. John, or 78 in all. 

The Ammonian sections and Eusebian 
canons are marked throughout, and there is 
a harmony at the foot of each page. The 
lessons too are rubricated in the text or on 
the margins in the usual way. 

A more recent Nestorian hand has altered 
the text in numerous passages, so as to 
bring it more into accordance with the 
ordinary Peshitta of the time. Eor instance : 
fol. 10 a, S. Matth. ch. vii. 17, we now read 

instead of f^l=^ r^ird&; fol. 12 a, ch. ix. 
29, f^i-a^K" ^^^ooo^ T»Kb , the word «^^ooeA 
has been erased ; fol. 15 a, ch. xU. 16, 
^aiK' >conro has been altered into tQ9r<b 
^..^omi^ ; foL 16 b, ch. xii. 45, r^ocbo 
co^v»r^ has been changed by erasure into 
bD^v» rdaocbo ; and so on. The same person 
has added numerous Syriac vowels, dia- 
critical points, and marks of punctuation, 
besides a few notes, referring to matters of 
pronunciation and grammar : e. g. fol. 14 ft, 

^aS^^ flui£o , marg. . ^. jlb ; fol. 18 a,

marg. •^ . oi^. Compare Add. 12,138 and 
Add. 14,448. 

The writing on fol. 156 ft has been care- 
fully erased, but enough can be deciphered 
to show that the page contains the com- 
mencement of the Epistle of S. Paul to the 
Romans, ch. i. 1 — 11, according to the Pe- 
shitta version. 

A reader called George has written his 
name in Greek, Syriac and Arabic, on foil.

manuscripts, the defects of which have been 
supplied by the insertion of a few leaves. 

I. Foil. 1—87. Vellum, about 11^ in. by 
8. The quires, which are nine in number, 
were originally signed with arithmetical 
figures (e.g. fol. 28, ^^; fol. 58, yu^;

text, at other times at the top of the page. 
Many have been marked on the margin by 
later hands. The Gospel of S. Matthew is 
divided on the margin into 22 sections; 
that of S.John into 16.

several have been marked by a later hand on 
the margin. 

Fol. 149 is a fragment of an old Arabio 
document on veUimi, apparently of the iv*^ 
cent, of the Hijra, which formed part of 
the ancient binding of the volimie. Of

xc. 

Vellum, about 8 in. by 4|, consisting of 
66 leaves, the first three of which are slightly 
stained. The quires were 8 in number, but 
the first is now lost. They seem to have 
been originally signed with arithmetical 
figures (though the ciphers on foil. 1 a and 
12 a are more recent), but the present sig- 
natures are letters. There are from 27 to 
31 Unes in each page. This manuscript is 
written in a beautiful, Edessene Estrangela, 
apparently of the v*^ cent.; with the excep- 
tion of fol. 12, which was probably added by 
the same person who retouched foil, 1 — 3. 
It contains — 

The first two Gtospels, according to the 
Peshitta version ; viz. 

S. Matthew, fol. 1, beginning with ch. vi. 20. 

S. Mark. Fol. 39 a. 

Many lessons have been noted on the 
margins by later hands. 

Pol. 12 is palimpsest, perhaps of the x*^ 
cent., the more ancient text being that of 
Jeremiah, 'ch. xli. 4 — 10, according to the 
Peshitta version, from a manuscript of the 
vi*^ cent. 

[Add. 14,459, foU. 1—66.]

Vellum, about llf in. by 9, consisting of 
68 leaves, some of which are slightly stained 
and soiled. The quires, 7 in number, seem 



to have been originally signed with letters. 
Each page is divided into two colunms, of 
from 22 to 27 lines. This manuscript is 
written in a good, regular Estrangela of the 
v*"^ or the beginning of the vi"* cent. ; with 
the exception of foil. 1, 8, 23, 24, 63, and 
64, which are perhaps three centuries later. 
Numerous diacritical points and marks of 
punctuation have been subsequently added 
throughout. It contains — 

The first two Gospels, according to the 
Peshitta version ; viz. 

S. Matthew. Fol. 1 *. 

S. Mark, fol. 63 a, ending with ch. ix. 10.

been noted on the margins by later hands.

S. Mark. Pol 68 b. The last page has

The old text is complete, with subscription; 
the later one reaches only as far as the words

Of the lessons some are rubricated in the

Vellum, about 8f in. by 5^, consisting of 
148 leaves, a few of which are much stained 
and torn, especially foil. 41, 42, 76, 147 and 
148. The quires are 16 in number, the first 
and second being imperfect. They are now 
signed with letters, and the folios have been 
numbered with Coptic arithmetical figures, 
up to e.C^> (i.e. 148, fol. 146 a). A leaf is 
wanting at the beginning, and another after 
fol. 7. There are from 18 to 26 lines in 
each page. This manuscript is written in a 
neat, regular Estrangela of the vi*'* cent., 
with the exception of fol. 7, which is of the 
i^th ^j. ^th^ ^^^ f^Yi 247 and 148, which are 

paper leaves of the xiii*^ cent. It contains — 

The first two Gospels, according to the 
Peshltta version ; viz. 

S. Matthew. Pol. 1 a. Missing portions : 
ch. i. 1 — 8 and iv. 24 — ^v. 15. 

S. Mark. Fol. 92 b. 

The lessons are rubricated in the text, and 
many more are indicated by later hands on 
the margins. The larger sections have also 
been noted on the margins in the Gtospel of 
8. Matthew, but not, as it would seem, in 
that of S. Mark.

written in a small, regular Estrangela of the 
vi*^ cent., with the exception of foil. 68 — 67, 
which are in a more current hand of the 
ix*^ or x*^ cent. It contains — 

The first two Gospels, according to the 
Peshltta version ; viz. 

S. Matthew. Fol. 1 b. The only portion 
missing is ch. vi. 3 — 20. 

S.Mark. Pol. 65 i. 

The lessons are rubricated in the text, one 
or two being marked on the margins by a 
later hand, e.g. fol. 104 J. 

On fol. 107 ft, between the subscription of 
the Gospel of S. Mark and the doxology, 
there was a rubric of two lines, which has 
been carefully erased. 

Of the writing on fol. 1 a but little is now 
distinctly legible, which is to be regretted, 
as it seems to be a nearly contemporary 
notice of the taking of Damascus by the 
Arabs, A.D. 634-5. The two most important 
passages read as follows.

The larger sections are marked both in the 
Syriac and Arabic texts (see in particular 
foil. 5 a and 10 a). 

The manuscript of which these leaves once 
formed part, is now deposited in the Univer- 
sity Library of Leipzig, having been brought 
from the convent of S. Mary Deipara, along 
with other fragments, by Dr. Tischendorf.* 
It has been carefully described and examined 
by Dr. Gildemeister in his treatise "de 
Evangeliis in Arabicum e Simplici Syriaca 
translatis Commentatio Academica,'' Bonn, 
1865. [Add. 14,467.]

S. Luke, according to the Peshitta version ; 
viz. 

S. Mark, ch. xiv. 71, 72, xv. 3—5, 8—11,

Vellum, about 8 in. by 5, consisting of 
103 leaves, the last 8 of which are much 
stained and soiled (Add. 14,459, foil. 67 — 
169). The quires, 11 in number, seem to 
have been originally signed with arith- 
metical figures (though the ciphers on fol. 
67 a are more recent), but the present sig- 
natures are letters (from J^ to J^). There 
are from 25 to 27 lines in each page. The

writiAg is a small, elegant Estrangela of the 
vi**' cent, (between A,D. 530 and 540). 
Fol. 74 is a palimpsest leaf, probably added 
by the same person who retouched foil. 162 
and 163. This manuscript contains — 

The last two Grospels according to the 
Peshitta version ; viz. 

S. Luke. Fol. 67 b. 

S. John. Pol. 126 ft. 

Many lessons have been noted on the 
margins by later hands, sometimes in bar- 
barous Greek (e.g. foil. 94 a, 105 ft, 107 ft, 
110 ft). 

On fol. 169 a stands the colophon : >Jlx. 

On fol. 169 ft we have the ordinary doxo- 
logy ; and imder it, at some distance below 
the coloured ornament, there is a note, much 
injured and effaced, containing the date: 
Aiita r^CD rds^ )a\iix.rt^ 

" This book was finished in the month of 
. . . , (in the year) 84 . . (of the Greeks)," 
i. e. A.D. 53 . . . Prom the remaining lines 
of the note it can be gathered that this manu- 
script was written at some person's expense, 
as a present to a church or monastery. Of 
the later writing, with which the greater part 
of this page is covered, but little is distinctly 
legible. He name of a village called Kephar- 
Tekirin, ^iA^^ i^ja^ ft^uiT^\ Acomi f<^v , 
occurs several times. 

On fol. 67 a there is an ornamental Cross, 
containing the words cna iaifloc co^cA iom 

hand. 

Fol. 74 is a palimpsest leaf of the ix*** or 
x**" cent., the more ancient text being that of 
S. Matthew, ch. iii. 6—9, 11—13, ch. iii. 16

version, from a manuscript in double 
columns of the vi*^ cent. The running title

212. The quires, signed with letters (from 
•A* onwards), are 11 in number. Leaves 
are wanting at the end, and also after 
foil. 206 and 211. There are from 24 to 
27 lines in each page. This manuscript is 
written in a good, regular hand of the 
ix*** or x*** cent., but has been unskilfully 
retouched in many places. It contains — 

The last two Gospels, according to the 
Peshitta version ; viz. 

S. Luke. Fol. 108 a. At the end, fol.

The text of this manuscript has been 
altered in many places on foil. 6 h — 8 a, in 
order to bring it into uniformity with that 
in common use. There is no indication of 
lessons, except on the margins by two or 
three more recent hands (see, for example, 
foU. 3 ft, 4 a, 6 ft, 25 ft, 33 ft, etc.). 

A note on fol. 1 a, in a current hand of 
about the x*** cent., informs us that the volume 
belonged to a monk named Habibai or Habib, 
who presented it to the convent of S. Mary

S. Luke, ch. i. 65 — 80, according to the Pe- 
shitta version. It was the first leaf of the 
second quire (us) of a lectionary, of the x*** 
cent, (see Add. 14,452, fol. 58). 

The text of the older portions of this manu- 
script has been edited, with a preface and 
translation, by the late Dr. Cureton (London, 
1858) ; whence it is generally known among 
biblical scholars by the name of the Cv/re- 
to7iian Syriac.

signed with letters, were originally 23 in 
number, but the first two are now lost. 
Each page is divided into two columns, 
of from 20 to 27 lines. This volume is 
written in a large, very angular Estrangela, 
with occasional Greek vowels, and dated 
A. Gr. 1247, A.D. 936. It contains—

Each Gospel is divided into r^rdL&o or 
chapters, of which there are 68 in S. Matthew, 
48 in S. Mark, 83 in S. Luke, and 19 in 
S. John. An index of these chapters is 
prefixed to each Gospel, viz. S. Mark, fol. 
44 a ; S. Luke, fol. 84 b ; and S. John, fol. 
153 b. That to S. Matthew is lost (but see 
Add. 14,456, foU. 1 and 2). 

The Anmionian sections and Eusebian 
canons are marked in the usual way, and 
there is a harmony at the foot of each page. 

The lessons are sometimes indicated in 
the text, but more usually by later hands on 
the margins. Eor this purpose green paint 
has occasionally been employed. 

At the end of the Gospel of S. John, 
after the subscription, stands the follow-

withch. ii. 4. Fol. 69 ft. 

The Epistle of S. Jude has been lost. 

4. The Epistles of S. Paul, in the usual 
order. Fol. 71 a. The missing portions are : 
Romans, ch. i. 1 — 32, vi. 1 — xi. 24; and 
Hebrews, ch. iv. 10 to the end. 

The above are all according to the Peshitta 
version. 

The Acts and the Catholic Epistles are 
divided on the margin into 32 sections (•aX, 
fol. 66 a) ; the Pauline Epistles into 50 (^ , 
fol. 169 a). 

There is also a Coptic division of the same 
portions of Scripture; viz. of the Acts into 
48 sections (^b, fol. 50a), the Epistle of 
S. James into 7 (9, fol. 56 a), S. Peter into 8 
(b, fol. 62 a), and S. John into 5 (g^, fol 
67 a). The second Epistle of S. Peter has 3 
of these sections (V^, fol. 70 ft). In the 
Pauline Epistles they are not marked. 

Of lessons there are scarcely any noted in 
the handwriting of the scribe (see fol. 63 a) ; 
but a later hand has marked many in the 
Acts, Catholic and other Epistles, as well 
as in those of S. Paul. A partial index to 
these last, f<ma\ j»e\aSk f^4jJLz..i jtea^.iao, 
has been written by the same hand on fol. 
51ft. 

The same reader has covered the margins 
of the volimae with various readings and 
notes. The various readings are either from 
other copies of the Peshitta {^^9 i. e. 
kW»^), or &om the Harklensian version 
(f<Apv*, ^tm or Aiuja). The notes are

The large sections have been marked on 
the margins, either by the letter^ (fd^Lu^) 
or by the ordinary mode of numeration ; and 
a few lessons have been noted by a modem 
hand. 

On fol. 1 a there is a note, apprising us 
that this was one of the volumes brought 
to the convent of S. Mary Deipara by the 
abbat Moses of Nisibis, K'v.vbi rdjLOsn 

On the margin of fol. 1 b there is written 
ni AnOC nAYA[OC], "the holy Paul.'' 

Pol. 62 is palimpsest, the more ancient text 
being that of a manuscript of the Epistles of 
S. Paul, according to the Peshitta version, 
written in two columns, of the vi*^ cent. 
It contains 1 Thessal. v. 15 — 2 Thessal. 
i. 8. A fragment of the same manuscript, 
containing Colossians iv. 6 — 12, has been 
used to replBtir fol. 121.

and 208. The quires, 21 in number, were 
originally signed with letters at the foot of 
the first page (fol. 10 a, .a ; fol. 20 a, -\^) ; 
at a subsequent period they were marked 
with Greek letters at the top (fol, 40 a, G ; 
fol. 50 a, < ; fol. 60 a, Z ; etc.) ; afterwards 
the first five leaves of each quire were num- 
bered on the verso, at the top, with Syriac 
letters q.nd Coptic arithmetical figures (e.g.

was noted by an Arabic numeral at the foot 
(e.g. foil. 9 J, J^l ; 29 J, AJb ; 49 J, d^\^ ; 
59 ft, jujU; etc.). Each page is divided 
into two columns, of from 16 to 20 Unes. 
This volume is written in a large Estrangela 
of the vi*^ cent. ; with the exception of foil. 
1 — 8 and 180 — 208, which are in a more 
angular and less elegant hand of the x*^ 
cent. Greek vowels have been occasionally 

added (r, ^, h, p, s^ e.g. coafii^.core^:ia, ^s ^)-

The lessons are marked in the usual way 
on the margins, some by the scribe, others 
by a later reader, who evidently drew up an 
index (r^!Jui.A •x.ia^), which is now lost, 
and also indicated certain chapters or sec- 
tions by the word r^oott^ (e.g. foU. 16 a, 
32 a, 37 ft, 41 a, 53 a, etc. 

The more recent portions of the manu- 
script were written by a scribe named John,

foot of the second column : ^x£n ^.i 1^

read: r^v.iA caAcia f^%% Aia r^^iu^ •:•

another note on the same page (r^coM r^Kb 
^cD ii9^ r^S^u f^iiniyi). This has, how- 
ever, been re-touched throughout, and the 
first part of it altered, so as to make it 
appear that the book was presented to the 
convent by one Zachariah, the son of Paul, 
the son of Bar-sauma : kImj^i i^i.^ i-^^% 

At the foot of fol. 142 b there now stand 
the following words, written over an erasure, 
perhaps by the same hand that altered the 
previous note : K'v.il rdico rdaAifk iCDa^K"

A note on fol. 161 a further informs us, 
that at this time Babban Yeshua* of Zargel 
Castra, near Hisn Kifa, was abbat of the con- 
vent of S. Mary Deipara ; and that Athana- 
sius was patriarch of Alexandria ;* but the 
name of the occupant of the see of Antioch 
is left blank, perhaps because of the conten- 
tion between Dionysius VII. and John bar

The first three inform us that this book 
was written by Babai the deacon, in the con- 
vent of Mar Gabriel (also called the convent 
of the Confessors) near Harran, in the year 
of the Greeks 1210 =A.D. 899, when Mar

and an anonymous critic, rdaflv, foil. 44 a,

part refer to matters of punctuation, or are 
explanatory of difficult words. As examples 

take the following. Fol. 24 5, r^^aaii coat

The marginal notes, which are mostly in 
the same handwriting as the text, refer 
principally to various readings or different 
modes of punctuation, more rarely to other 
matters. The yarious readings are usually 
indicated by the word M^hsxsn or jA^iiaLSoo, 
" and there is found," abbreviated hsxsn or 
jiLsn; but sometimes in other ways, e.g. 
rdkMi^ (fol. 46 a) or KLiH*»re' (fol. 200 b). 
Not a few are taken from the Septuagint : 
^^i^iT^a (fol. 59 b), ^^i^nT.1 , m or X; and 
one of these is inserted in the text, Ps. xl. 6, 
fol. 58 &, . ^^^^ r€l rdUaiflUBD rdML3.ia

See Add. 7183, fol. 122 b; and Assemani, 
Bibl. Orient., t. i. p. 477, no. 6, and p. 478, 
no. 8.* It has been edited by Dr. Phillips, 
" A letter by Max Jacob, bishop of Edessa, 
on Syriac Orthography," etc., London, 1869, 
and by the Abb4 Martin, " Jacobi episcopi 
Edesseni Epistola,'* etc., Paris, 1869. 

2. A tract on the tenses, persons, genders, 
diacritical marks, and signs of punctuation : 

f<i4%a. Pol. 228 a. See Add. 7183, fol. 
125 a; and Assemani, Bibl. Orient., t. i. 
p. 477, no. 6. This tract has also been edited 
by Dr. Phillips and the Abb^ Martin. 

3. A tract on the signs of pimctuation or 
accents, showing by examples how they are

* From the former of these two passages of the BibL 
Orient, it is clear that this is the identical manuscript 
which Assemani had in his hands in the convent of S. 
Maiy Deipara, though he has somewhat strangely described 
it as containing a lexicon. 



Pol. 234 b. See Opera, ed. Petavius, t. ii. 
pp. 135 — 149 ; Migne, Patrol. Gr., t. xliii.,

Joam (1 Kings ch. xiii.), are placed after 
that of Malachi, whilst those of Azariah, 
Elijah and Elisha are omitted.

Vellum, about 9 in. by 5^, consisting of 
77 leaves, many of which are much stained 
and slightly torn, especially folL 1, 2, 15, 23, 
31, 41, 50, and 77. The quires are eight in 
number, the last being imperfect. What 
the original signatures were, can no longer be 
discovered. The number of lines in each page 
varies from 27 to 31. This volume is written 
in a small, elegant character, not later than 
the year 911, A.D. 600, with the exception of 
foil. 47, 61, and 73 — 76, regarding which see 
below. It contains —

thing is, that such titles should be prefixed to the ordi- 
nary PSshifta version, and that too in a manusoript dated 
A.D. 600. See the similar heading in the Bodleian manu-

If The Nestorians and their Rituals, yoL ii 
p. 22 : '' The Psalms are always chanted bj two persons, 
sometimes by the officiating priests and deacons, and 
sometimes by laymen. The priests usually recite them 
from memory, but the laymen from the written Psalter. 
A Psalter is placed on each side of the chancel, and after 
one Yerse is chanted, the person on the opposite side 
chants the second, and so on alternately until the ap- 
pointed portion is ended."

Paper, about 5^ in. by 3J, consisting, ac- 
cording to the present numeration, of 101,

which are much stained by water and torn, 



* I.e., the two songs of Moses and the song of Isaiah. 
See Badger^ The Nestorians and their Rituals, vol. ii. p. 21. 

t The difference is owing to the insertion of slips of 
paper, on which such portions of the text as had become 
illegible were copied out by a later hand. These slips 
were originally pasted down upon the leaves, but have 
now become loosened, and are numbered as separate folios. 



more especially foil. 1 — ^11, and 80 — ^lOL 
The volume is very defective, both at the 
beginning and end, and a leaf is wanting 
after fol. 69. Each page is divided into two 
columns, of from 16 to 20 lines. The writing 
is small and neat, of about the ziii^ cent.; 
but foil. 14 — 47 and 60—69 are of some- 
what later date, and the inserted slips later 
still. This volume contains — 

The Psalms, according to the Peshitta vi- 
sion, divided into r^hsj^isn . The missing 
portions are: Ps. i. 1 — xlii. 7; IxxiiL 7 — 
bmv. 2; civ. 24r-cvi. 42 (fol. 88 being 
almost completely torn out) ; and cxviii. 1 
to the end (foil. 97—101 being much muti- 
lated). In the older portions of the manu- 
script there are some attempts at ornamen- 
tation ; see fol. 79 J, etc. 

On fol. 47 b there are recorded the names 
of two readers, John and Jacob, the former 
in Syriac, the latter in Arabic. ,^ \^

number. They are signed with letters, at 
the top of the page, from t^ to w and from u

the beginning and end, as well as after folL 
80, 122, 155, 163, and 257. This volume is 
written in an inelegant hand of the xiii*** 
or xiv*^ cent., inclining to the Malkite type, 
and contains — 

The Psalms, according to the Peshitta ver- 
sion, divided into Kodlafutra, each xdOurfui 
(f^isnj^hin) being subdivided into f<uscuL 
(marked oZ). Ps. cxviii. is in three parts, 
to each of which other hymns and prayers 
are appended; see foil. 189 i, 198 a, and

mencement of each versicle is marked by the 
letter f<, and the versicle is divided by od

Many of the titles are written with 
green and yellowish brown paint. 
The erased text of the palimpsest portions of 
this volume is written in a small, neat hand 
of the viii*^ or ix^ cent.* It is part of a Syriac 
translation of the works of Galen, with the 
notes or commentary of Gesius (Hcrw, 
\j^}i^W)f arranged, it would appear, in 
parallel columns. The running titles, which 
are still visible on the outer margins of some 
leaves^ are . «iB»aiAf^\^ and .itoflUMOQ^ • 
See, for example, foil. 34 b, 74 b, 100 &, 144 6, 
146 a and 6, 155 6, 166 ft, 178 *, 196 b, and 
246 b. Other portions of the same text 
are to be found in Add. 17,127 ; and to it

Add. 14,486 and 14,487.

of the licssons, fol. 4 6, richly coloured with 
various paiiits. On fol. 3 b there is an illu- 
minated cross; and a similar one on fol. 
194i a. 

Greek words are occasionally written on 
the margins, but very rudely and incor- 
rectly. See, for example, foil. 98 a, 104 J, 
106 a, 114 a, 116 a, 123 a, 129 a and 6,

A. Gr. 1616, A.D. 1305, relates to the clear- 
ing out (?) of a weU, or rather cistehiy 
called the Camels' well, situated close to the 
convent of Malchus, and to the tonsure of 
certain monks. ii«»^f^ gu J»o KSsAft" kuLs

This portion of the manuscript has been 
edited by Dr. Land in his Anecdota Syriaca, 
t. i., with a Latin translation and notes..

handwriting of Moses of Nisibis, stating that 
he procured this manuscript for the convent 
of S. Mary Deipara (A.D. 932).

Six veUum leaves, about 9^ in. by 6J.

longed apparently to a manuscript of the 
Gospels of the xii*** cent. 

[Add. 17,218, foU. 91—96.] 

* As it would seem, purposely erased by some reader, 
who confounded the Emperor with the Pope, usually styled

There are some marginal notes in this 

manuscript, written by the scribe, mostly in 
Arabic. Occasionally they are explanatory 
of words or readings in the text ; e.g. fol. 

4 a, KVtriAi, marg. JAi ; fol. 12 a, AAuftl^^re', 
marg. ^ *a\; fol. 14 a, itLJii^, marg. 
^li, Joi/; fol. 32 ay jie&sorfx i<A«*.o, 
marg. ^>a^ ^^ k£JjJ\ ^j^^^ u^. ^r^^ ^^3 5 
fol. 79 *, ,^*i^rci3.i , marg. t^) Jsj^ ^\ . 
More usually, however, they refer to the 
lessons ; e. g. foil. 11 a, 16 J, 20 6, 25 a, 26 a, 
and 78 h. 



Coptic numer&lif are sometimeB used by 
the scribe, either aloixe or in connection i^itli 
Arabic ones^ to number the leayes, e.g. foil. 
23— 42, or the lessons, e.g. foil. 37 a, 59 a^ 
65 a and &, 66 d, 67 d, 68 a, 69 h, and 73 a. 

There are a few attempts at ornamentation ; 
e.g. foil. 27 a, 28 a, 45 h, and 49 a.

mutilated. It informs us that this Lection- 
ary was drawn up according to the use of 
the convent of Beth-' Abe, which was institu- 
ted by its founder Rabban Jacob. The name of 
the scribe was Daniel, and he wrote it A.D. 
1206 — 07j when Tab-alaha* was Catholic 
Patriarch of Seleucia and Ctesiphon. >Ll

Foil. 1 and 2 contain a modem index to all 
the portions of Scripture comprised in this 
Lectionary. 

On foL 187 b there is the autograph of 
"Edwf Ives of Titchfield, Hants," followed 
by a note, dated "Turkey 1768, Sunday 
July 2^** which states that the volume was 
purchased of a Deacon of the old Christian 
Church "at a poor Christian Town, called 
Camalisk-Glawerkoe, i.e. (as we were told) 
Christian-Gawerkoe, situated about a six 
hours journey to the southward of Mosul or 
Mosoul (ancient Nineveh)." In this church 
" the Relicts of Saint Barbara are entombed." 

This manuscript once belonged to Dr. 
Adam Clarke. See the Catalogue of his 
Library, compiled by J. B. B. Clarke (Lon* 
don, 1835), p. 119.

A.D. 1046, in the convent of Elias, on the 
Black Mountain called the Boar's Head^ 
near Antioch, by a priest named John, from 
the town of rOauci; and was paid for by a 

priest named Abba (the name of Da- 

mianus is a later alteration), also from the 
town of f^fiuax , a disciple of the abbat 
Abba Joseph. The writing of it was super- 
intended by the monk Abba ■ (the words 

** Thepdore the priest " are a later alteration).

Nearly the whole of this volume is pa* 
limpsest, the scribe haying made use of 
parts of at least three older manuscripts. 

One of these is written in two columns, in 
a good Estrangela of the vi*^ or vii*^ cent, 
(see, for example, foil. 5, 7—10, 12, 16, 17, 
27, 28, 75, 76, 83, etc.), and seems to have 
comprised the books of Joshua and Judges, 
according to the Teshitta version. For in- 
stance, fol. 7 contains Joshua vii. 7—16; 
fol. 8 ft. Judges ii. 22— iii. 9; fol. 75, Judges 
X. 1 — 15 ; fol. 76, Judges xiii. 14 — ^xiv. 8 ; 
and fol. 83, Joshua xiv. 7 — ^xv. 8. On fol. 
17 b we find the title of a lesson, r^Li^ia 

From a second manuscript, written in a 
fine Estrangela of the vi*^ cent., but not 
divided into columns, are taken, for example, 
foil. 42, 43, 69 and 70. The contents cannot 
be stated with certainty, though rubrics are 
still partially legible on foil. 69 b and 70 a. 

The greater portion of the book, however, 
appears to have belonged to a manuscript of 
the vii**" cent., written in two columns, in 
a small, neat Estrangela, containing the 
second part of the treatise of Severus against 
Joannes Qrammaticus of CsBsarea, as is evi- 
dent from the running title on fol. 84 J, 

[Add. 14,496.]

Twelve vellum leaves, about 7 in. by 5|, 
all more or less torn (Add. 14,667, foil. 17 — 
28). There are from 17 to 23 lines in each 
page. The writing is of the x**^ or xi*** cent. 
They formed part of a Sacerdotal and con- 
tain — 

1. Prayers, prooemia, and sedras, intro- 
ductory to the celebration of the holy Eucha- 
rist. Imperfect. Fol. 17 a. 

2. An Anaphora; imperfect both at the 
beginning and end. Fol. 23 a. 

These leaves are palimpsest, but the ori-

us that this manuscript was written in the

8. The forty Martyrs; imperfect. Pol. 
142 6. 

As a palimpsest, this volume comprises 
parts of three manuscripts. 

a. A manuscript of the book of Isaiah, 
according to the Peslutta version, written in 
two columns, in a fine Estrangela of the 
vi*^orvii*^cent. Poll, 67— 124. The running 
title r^AiAf^is still clearly visible on foil, 
74 a, 83 a, 94 a, 96 a, 102 a, 103 a, at the 
foot; and on foil. 75 a, 84 6, 100 b, 108 6, 
113 6, 122 ft, and 124 a, at the top. The 
text is most distinctly legible on foil. 69 and 
72, the latter of which contains ch. xvi. 1 — 
xvii. 2, and the former, ch. xvii. 2 — ^xviii. 3. 

b. A manuscript written in two columns, 
in a small, neat hand of the vi*^ or vii"* cent. 
It contains discourses, one of which at least 
bears the title (foil. 135 b and 139 d, at the 
top) rd*.ioca* IaooX.!, '^against the Jews.'' 
PoU. 36—66 and 125—144. 

c. A manuscript written in a good Estran- 
gela of the vi*^ or vii*^ cent. PoU. 1-^5. 
It appears to contain discourses of Jacob of 
Batnae, but enough of the text has not been 
deciphered to make this quite certain. 

[Add. 14,512.]

Vellxmi, about 8| in. by 5|, consisting of 
191 leaves. The quires, 21 in number, are

after foil. 144, 170, and 171. There are from 
25 to 30 lines in each page, except in the 
last quire, where the number varies from 20 
to 23. The greater part of this volxmie, foil. 
1 — 180, is written in a small, neat hand of 
the x^ cent. ; the last quire, foil. 181—189, 



was added A. Gr. 1345, A.D. 1034. It

At the end of this canon, fol. 189 a, is the 



following rubric: kLsco kLq^iala >1jl 

On foL 189 J there are two notes, in the same 
handwriting as that of the last nine leaves. 
The first states that this book belonged to 
the deacon Theodore, of the convent of Bar- 
Bushair, who purchased it out of his private 

means (f^cnX ft':! r^in^x ^, jJJ\ jj^ ^^=rd5« 

f<n\r^.*i coiinni\ ^i.*i , 4)d]\ ^^ U) ; the other,

On fol. 189 a and J, at the top of the page, 
are written in a rude hand the words 

** this book belongs to the priest Simon." 

The same person, apparently, has filled 
the remainder of fol. 189 ft, as well as foil. 
190 and 191 a, with part of the history of the 
Invention of the Cross for the second time

In another note, at the foot of the page, 
in the handwriting of one Peter of Bartella, 
we are told that the second purchaser Zakhe, 
whose proper name was Jacob, was by birth 
a Tagritan, and a monk of the monastery of 
Mar Matthew on the mountain of Elpheph,

The note on fol. 1 a is so much effiwjed, 
that only a very few words are here and 
there legible. The writing on the margins 
of many of the leaves (doubtless additional 
hymns and prayers) has also been in great

CCCXIX. 

Vellum, 16f in. by 12f , consisting of 235 
leaves, some of which are slightly stained 



and soUed. The quires, 23 in number, are 
signed with letters. Each page is divided 
into two colimms, of from 24 to 39 lines. 
The writing is a large, regular Estrangela, 
with a few Greek vowels. This volume was 
written A. Gr. 1318, A.D. 1007, as appears 
from the colophon of Add. 12,148. The 
handwritings on foil. 6 5, 6, 7 a, and 235, 
are more modem ; and the same hands have 
occasionally addedmai^inalnotes throughout 
the volume. There are some attempts at 
ornamentation; see, for example, on foil. 
17 a, 56 a, 65 a, 72 6, 106 b (two birds), 
109 ft, 173 a, 182 a, and 193 a. It con- 
tains —

consist of canons, chants, hymns and prayers 
for the various hours of the festivals and 
other holy days of the Church. The names 
of the authors are not attached to the 
canons, chants or hymns, though some of 
the madrashe are ascribed on the margins to 
Ephraim (e.g. foil. 34 ft, 50 a, 67 ft, 83 a, 
128 ft, 138 ft, 139 ft, 143 ft, 212 a and ft) ; 
whereas theba'avathaare invariably assigned 
either to Ephraim or Jacob of Batnae, 
according to the metre in which they are 
composed.

Vellum, 16f in. by 12f , consisting of 369 
leaves, many of which are stained and torn. 
Originally the number of quires must have 
been about forty, fol. 346 being signed jA ; 
but not a few are now defective, especially 
from fol. 299 onwards. In the earlier part 
of the volume there are lacunae after foil. 
10, 27 and 296. The hand is the same as 
that of Add. 12,146. It was written A. Gr. 
1317, A.D. 1006, as appears from the 
colophon of Add. 12,149, and has many 
rather rudely drawn ornaments; e.g. foil. 
76 a, 97 a (two birds), 99 a (a tree and two 
birds), 108 h (a bird), 110 a (a bird), 113 h 
(a bird), 117 a, 167 a (a bird), 173 a (a 
fish), 174 a (a hand with a branch), 186 h (the 
same), 188 6, 196 a, 199 a, 217 a, 247 a (two 
feet), 262 a (a hand), 281 a, 286 a (two 
birds), 293 a, 321 a (a hand), and 329 h. 
Foil. 4, 5, 32, 33, 56, 56, 77, 78, 102, 103, 
127 and 128, are supplementary paper leaves, 
inserted apparently during the xiii*^ cent. 
This volume contains —

There are no running titles. As in Add. 
12,146, some of the madrashe are ascribed 
on the margins, by later hands, to Ephraim 



{e.g. foil. 170 a and 171 h) and Jacob (e.g. 
fol. 136 J), whilst the ba^avatha are attributed 
in the text to either the one or the other, 
according to the metre.

Vellum, 15 J in. by 12|, consisting of 233 
leaves. The quires, 24 in number, are 
signed with letters. In all external respects 
this volume is precisely similar to Add. 
12,146. It was written A. Gr. 1318, A.D. 
1007, and contains — 



The first part of a Choral Service-book for 
the circle of the whole year, comprising the 
same services as Add. 12,146, except that 
the more modem portions (no. 1, d and e, 
and no. 20) have not been added. Although^ 
however, the services are the same, yet the 
hymns, prayers, etc., which compose each ser- 
vice, are often very different. Hence, in the 
f<^<uMACo.i f^ixa^j foil. 9 b and 10 a, we 
find that John (Chrysostom), Cyril, Dioscorus, 
Ephraim, Isaac (of Antioch), Jacob (of Bat- 
nae) and Fhiloxenus (of Mabug) are blessed; 
whilst curses are bestowed upon Bardaisan, 
Marcion, Audius (>.ia^), Mani, and Anus.

CCCXXII. 

Vellum, about 16J in. by 12^, consisting 
of 84 leaves, many of which are much 
stained and torn. In all external respects 
this volume is precisely similar to Add. 12,147, 
and is dated A. Gr. 1317, A.D. 1006. It 
must, therefore, have originally contained 
about 40 quires (fol. 61 is signed .lA) ; but 
the greater part of it has been gradually lost 
and destroyed. For specimens of ornaments 
see foil. 27 b and 30 a. Foil. 33 and 34 are 
supplementary paper leaves, exactly similar 
to those described in Add. 12,147. Fol. 63 
has also been repaired with paper. It con- 
tains — 

The second part of a Choral Service-book 
for the circle of the whole year, comprising 
the same services as Add. 12,147, but dif- 
fering considerably in the hymns, prayers, 
etc., which compose each service. 

1. Lent ; very imperfect. Foil. 2 b — 35 b. 
After this there is a huge lacuna, extending 
from 1 ^, o to 5 A in Add. 12,147.

portions of two older manuscripts. 

a. A manuscript of the book of Judges, 
according to the Peshitta version, written in 
a fine large Estrangela of the vi*** cent. Poll 
139—205. The running title, f<\ % V. , is 
still visible on foil. 167 a, at the foot ; 190 a,

the foot. 

ft. A manuscript written in a neat Estran- 
gela of the vii**' or viii**' cent. The contents 
appear to be liturgical (sedras, prayers, etc.). 
For example, a section begins on fol. 44 ft

This volume is palimpsest throughout, 
being written on parts of no less than four 
older manuscripts. 

1. EoU. 1—8, 11—30, 35—44, and 46—49. 
Leaves from a manuscript, written in three 
columns (e.g. foL 8), in a small, elegant 
Estrangela, apparently of the vi*^ cent. 
The contents cannot be stated with certainty, 
as the rubrics are almost entirely eflEaced; 
but it seems to have been a volume of 
rc'AL^cLo*^ or Demonstrations from the 
Eathers ; e.g. fol. 7 a^ AJud [i^] .90^0, and

from another manuscript, written in two 
columns, in a fine Estrangela of the vi*^ or

a running title, apparently iuas f^!z.i.Tsn 

3. FoU. 50—136, 139—157, 160—187, 
and 189. Leaves from a manuscript, written 
in a good, regular Estrangela of the vii*^ 
cent. They evidently belonged to one of 
the ordinary Sacerdotals, comprising ana- 
phoras, prayers, etc. The rubrics have, 
unfortunately, invariably disappeared. 

4. Eoll. 137, 138, 158, 159, and 188. 
Leaves from a manuscript of about the viii*** 
cent. The contents seem to be similar to 
those of no* 3.

Vellum, about 5f in. by 4f , consisting of 
60 leaves, some of which are much stained

The quires, signed with letters, are six in 
number, the last being imperfect. Each 
page has from 13 to 17 lines. This volume, 
which is palimpsest throughout, is written

This volume is palimpsest throughout, 
being made up of parts of three manuscripts. 

1. Poll. 35 — 40. Six leaves from a Syriac 
manuscript of about the ix*^ cent.; neatly 
written, but so much effaced that the con- 
tents can no longer be ascertained. 

2. Poll. 52—60. Nine leaves from a 
Syriac manuscript of the vi*^ or vii*^ cent., 
written in a large Estrangela. So completely 
has the ancient writing been erased that it 
is visible only on foil. 54 a and 57 b. 

3. PoU. 1—34 and 41—51. Portions of 

an Arabic manuscript, written in a good, 

legible hand of the iv*^ cent, of the Higra 

(probably about A.D. 950). The contents

On fol. 75 a there is a long note, in which 
the writer of the manuscript, Jacob, — ^who 
styles himself ^^Xottovo?, i^iAsaj^. >i»i (com- 
pare Add. 14,685), — states that these hymns 
of Severus, John bar Aphtunaya, John 
Psaltes, and others, — in all 365, of which 295 
are by Severus, — ^were translated from Greek 
into the Edessene or Syriao tongue, by Paul, 
bishop of Edessa*, whilst residing in Cyprus, 
whither he had been driven by the Persians ; 
and revised and corrected, with the help of 
Greek manuscripts, by himself, Jacob, in the 
year of the Greeks 986 (A.D. 675), according 
to the era of Seleucus Nicator, king of 
Syria. He then goes on to say that he has 
distinguished careftdly between the words of 

* ABsemani, Bibl. Or., t. iL p. 47, supposes the trans- 
lator to have been Paul of Callinicus. There seems to be 
some confusion here. Paul, bishop of Callimcus, who 
translated the homilies and seyeral other works of 
Seyerus, at Edessa, flourished about A.D. 500 — 530. 
His contemporary, Paul, bishop of Edessa, was ordained^ 
according to Assemani (Bibl. Or., t. L p. 407), A. Gr. 
821, A.D. 510; exiled to Euchaita (p. 411), A.Gr. 833, 
A.D. 522; restored to his bishopric (p. 413), A.Gr. 837, 
A.D. 526 ; and died in the following year. Lastly, the 
abbat Paul, the translator of Gregory Nazianzen, was in 
Cyprus, A.D. 624. Compare Bibl. Dr., t. i. pp. 171, 172, 
and Add. 12,153, foL 15. 



the author, and those which were added by 
the translator for the sake of the rhythm^ 
writing the former with common (black) ink, 
the latter with red paint. Whereyer the 
translator deviated at aU from the original, 
for the same reason, he has inserted a more 
literal rendering in small, neat characters 
between the lines.!

and likewise given the Greek form of most of the proper 
names that occur; as also, that the titles of aU the

The reasons for supposing that this manu- 
script is an autograph of the famous Jacob, 
bishop of Edessa, are — 

1. The antiquity of the volume. 

2. The character of the handwriting, 
which is not regular enough for that of a 
professional scribe. 

3. The absence of any indication of another 
scribe. 

4. The care with which the specifications 
contained in the note, fol. 75 a^ have been 
adhered to throughout the whole volume, 
thus giving it an entirely different character 
and appearance from those of such copies as 
Add. 18,816. Hymn 271 (r^^), fol. 61 i, 
may serve as an example, a line marking the 
words and letters which are written with red 
paint. The title, as far as r^JAo , is yellow.

CCCCXXII. 

Vellum, about 7| in. by 6 J, consisting of 
115 leaves, the first of which, being blank, 
is not numbered. A few of them are slightly 
stained and soiled. The quires, signed with 
letters, are 12 in number. There are from 
23 to 33 lines in each page. This volume is 
written in a good, regular hand of the ix*^ 
cent., and contains — 

The Hymns of Severus, patriarch of An- 
tioch, John bar Aphtunaya, abbatof Kinnesrin, 
John Psaltes, etc., as translated by Paul of 
Edessa, and revised by Jacob of Edessa. See 
Add. 17,134, from which manuscript, or one 
very similar to it, the present seems to have 
been copied. 

The hymns are preceded by an index:

Poll. 113 and 114 contain a ft:x.i.vo

proper names and other words, written in 
Greek uncials, as well as numerous Bible- 
references. The Biblical texta are only occa* 
sionaUy given in full, e.g. fol. 52 b.

Vellum, about B^ in. by 3|, consisting of 91 
leaves, many of which are much stained and 
soiled. The quires are signed with letters ; 
but several are missing at the beginning and 
end, and there is a lacuna after fol. 8. Some 
other lacunse have been supplied by a later 
hand. The number of lines in each page 
varies from 18 to 22. The greater part of 
this manuscript is written in a small, neat 
hand of the ix*"" or x*^ cent. ; with the 
exception of foil. 42—44, 49, and 80—91, 
which are of the xii**^ or xiii*** cent. It con«

According to a note on fol. 105 a, thig 
manuscript was written at ?lunia, or Iconium^ 
by one Abraham MaHh : .ui\^ ^coiare .s^ 

There are a considerable number of small 
ornamental devices in this volume, coloured 
with red, yellow and green paints. 

From fol. 117 onwards, it contains nume- 
rous paUmpsest leaves, several of which 
belong to the rare class of double palim- 
psests* They appear to have been taken 
from no less than five manuscripts. 

1. Foil. 117 and 126. These are portions 
of two leaves from a Greek manuscript of 
the Gospel of 8. John, written in double 
columns, in elegant uncials of the iv* or y^ 
cent. The one leaf contains ch. xiii., w. 16, 
17, 19, 20, 23, 24, 26, and 27; the other, 
ch. xvi. w. 7, 8, 12, 13, 16, 16, 18, and 19. 
See Tischendorf, Monunmi. Sacra Inedita, 
Nova CoUectio, vol. ii., p. xiii. and pp. 311, 
312. Over these texts a Syrian scribe of the 
ix*^ cent, has written selections from several 
authors. For example, on fol. 117 b we find 

extracts from Ephraim, .^i&r^[»ido].i ooLs 



; and on fol. 126 b there is 
a section beginning : . f^a^jJLsL rd^&ios 

2. FoU. 120, 137, and 139. Three di- 
palimpsest leaves. Both of the ancient texts 
are Syriac, written in two columns, the one 
in an ordinary Estrangela of the vi**' or 
vii**^ cent., the other in a small character 
of the viii*^ or ix^ cent. They are yery 
indistinct.

Pauline Epistles, according to the Peshitta 
version, written in a fine, large Estrangela of 
the vi*** or vii*^ cent., On fol. 126 a we find 
the commencement of the Epistle to the 
Oalatians, ch. i. w. 1, 2, ; and on foil. 147 a 
and 148 6, the running title i^caait^ iioX.i , 
" to the Ephesians." 

4. PoU. 118, 123, 133, 141, 146, and 149, 
are leares from another Syriao manuscript, 
written in a neat, small Estrangela of about 
the viii*^ cent. The contents appear to be 
liturgical (see foil. 145 h and 149 a). 

5. Pol. 146 is a leaf from a Syriac manu- 
script, written in a small, elegant hand of 
ubout the viii*^ cent. 

PoU. 119, 121, 122, 127, 129, 134, and 
144, do not present any traces of being 
palimpsest.

Vellum, about 9 in. by 5|, consisting of 
161 leaves, the first three of which are much 
Stained and torn. The quires w6re originally 
20 in number, but the last two are now lost. 
They are signed with Syriac letters on the 
first leaf of each, and by a later hand with 
Greek letters on the last leaf. The number 
of lines in each page varies from 26 to 31. 
This volume is written in a clear, though 
rather inelegant Estrangela of the viii*^ or 
ix*** cent., and contains — 

A collection of hymns (K!s.i.iaQ , r^huisLso , 
etc.), prayers, lessons and services for various 
occasions. The title, foL 4, enumerates some 



things that are no longer to be found in the 
volume, and omits others that really occur

165 a. 

FolL 2, 3, and 4 a, contain hymns, in a 
more cursive character, but probably of the 
fiame age, perhaps written in part by the 
same hand, as the rest of the manuscript 
(compare the, marginal notes on foU. 145 b 
and 151 a). 

Fol. 1 is a fragment of an ancient Arabic 
manuscript, of the iv*** cent, of the Hijra. 
It is part of a collection of traditions (c^j^) 

on various legal points. The portions legible 
refer chiefly to the distribution of spoil 
taJcen in battle, IijJUll mmJ,

Three vellum leaves, the second and third 
of which are much mutilated. There are 
from 31 to 34 lines in each page. The

Madrashe for the Commemoration of the 
Saints, rdz*.ia3 f^i^a.v3> the Prophets and 
the Apostles, rd4jJjL.io KUai.i r^i^o^-a , 
and some hymns (r^lii) on the Eesurrection

Vellum, about 8| in. by 5|, consisting of 
27 leaves, a few of which are much stained 
and torn, especially foil. 11 — ^14, 26, and 27. 
The quires, signed with letters, were origi- 
nally at least 9 in number {\ , fol. 27 a), 
but only one of them (i) is now complete, 
leaves being wanting at the beginning and 
end, as well as after foil. 4, 10, 14, 24, 25, 
and 26. Each page is divided into two 
columns of from 31 to 60 lines. This volume 
is written in a small, neat hand of the viii*'' 
or ix*^ cent., and seems to have once con- 
tained — 

Hymns and discourses for various festivals 
and other occasions ; but the present con-

BeliquisB Juris Eccles. Antiq., p. ua , and

These leaves are palimpsest. The older 
text, which is written in a small, neat hand 
of about the ix^ cent., is part of the DisBtdtSs 
of Joannes Philoponus of Alexandria (see 
Add. 12,171). The running title «a!^9

several occasions, one of which is ascribed to 
Severus, rdMjttas z<\%so Au^ok' f<(^al^ 

These leaves are palimpsest, but hardly a

of the ix*^ cent., is now legible.

DVI. 

Six vellum leaves, about 7 in. by 5, all of 
which but one are much torn (Add. 14,664, 
foil. 18, 19, 30—83). With the exception of 
fol. 33, they are palimpsest ; but foil. 19 b 
and 31 a, as well as part of foL 30 d, have 
not been re-written. 

The more modem texts, written in a coarse 
Estrangela of the xii*^ or xiii*^ cent., are — 

1. Fn^ments of prayers. PolL 18, 30, 31 &, 
and 32. 

2. A fragment of a letter, seemingly ad- 
dressed to the monks of four convents 
(rf^vn .:kS9Hf^a.i). An abbat is mentioned 
(^ f^i*w»iA), and one rabban Yuhannan or 
John (^a* pio). Fol. 19 a. 

The older text is written in the Pales- 
tinian character, in a large, regular hand, 
perhaps of the x*** cent. The contents ap- 
pear to be hymns in praise of martyrs. 

[Add. 14,664, folL 18, 19, 30—33.] 

DVII. 

Four vellum leaves, about 11^ in. by 8f , 
much stained and mutilated, and all palim- 
psest. 

1. The more recent text consists of prayers, 
mostly written in a coarse Estrangela of the 
xii**' or xiii*^ cent. 

2. The older text is written in a fine, re- 
gular Estrangela, of the v*^ or vi*** cent., in 
two columns of 26 or 27 lines, and once 
formed part of the apocryphal >^ia.t cii*oal 
>*i» , Add. 14,484, foil. 1—8. See above, 
p. 99, no. clviii, and Wright's Contributions 
to the Apocryphal Literature of the N. T., 
preflBbce, p. 13. 

[Add. 14,665, foU. 21—24.] 



Dvm. 

A vellum leaf, much stained and muti- 
lated. It is palimpsest, but re-written on 
one side only. The more recent text seems 
to be part of the same manuscript as the 
preceding number. The older text, appa. 
rentiy of the x*^ cent., is too much eflfetced to 
be legible, 

[Add. 14,665, fol. 25.] 



DIX. 

Six paper leaves, about 6^ in. by 4|, the 
first and last of which are slightiy torn (Add.

THEOLOGY. 



IlfDIYIDUAL AUTHORS. 



DXXVII. 

Two vellum leaves, both rQuch mutilated. 
The writing is a fine, regular Estrangela of 
the vi''' cent. They contain — 

Part of the Epistle of Eusebius of Csesarea 
to Carpianus, followed by fragments of the 
Eusebian canons. The subscription of the 
epistle is : ooAaoson^ .s^.i (<'iii\r^ ioaix. 

[Add. 17,213, foU. 4, 5.] 



DXXYIII. 

Vellum, about 12f in. by 10, consisting of 
173 leaves, some of which are much stained 
and torn, especially foU. 1 — 4, 41, 86 — 89, 
109, 169, and 173. The quires are 22 in 
number, but it does not appear what the 
original signatvires were. Leaves are now 
wanting after foU. 6, 21, and 167. Each 
page is divided into two columns, of from 
24 to 34 lines. This volume is written in a 
fine, regular Estrangela of the vi'" cent., and 
contains — 

The works of Aphraates, J^cDv&re*, or 
Earhad, .iK'eniA, "the Persian Sage," 
r<>Qoi^ r^soAAo* , a contemporary of Jacob 



of Nisibis and Ephraim, and bishop of the 
convent of Mar Matthew near Mosul (ac- 
cording to a note in Orient. 1017, fol. 160 a, 

,Aoa). He flourished about A.D. 337—345. 
At some period of his life, perhaps when he 
was made bishop, he took the name of 
Jacob, and hence his writings have been 
ascribed from a very early period to his 
more widely known namesake Jacob of 
Nisibis. His works consist of 22 homilies, 
in the form of Epistles, each commencing 
with a letter of the alphabet in the usual 
sequence, and a separate treatise entitled 
rtr^o^ or " the Cluster of Grapes." They 
were very soon translated into Armenian, 
and this translation has been published by 
N. Antonelli (Rome, 1756), and reprinted 
in Gallandii Bibliotheca Veterum Patrum, 
t. v., as also at Venice in 1765, and at Con- 
stantinople in 1824. The Syriac text has 
been edited by Wright (London, 1869).*

ascribed in the Armenian version to Gregory 
the Illuminator, has been torn away; but 
on fol. 1 b, between the columns, a later 
hand has written : k'^clw^.i r<'A>[i^r<'] .vn

It was written, according to the author's 
own statement, fol. 173 b, in the 36th year 
of the reign of Shahur, king of Persia, A.Gr. 
656, A.D. 345, suhsequently to the compo-

DXXIX. 

Vellum, about lOJ in. by 8|, consisting of 
99 leaves, some of which are much stained 
and torn, especially foU. 1, 2, 8, 40 — 42, and 
99. The quires, 13 in number, were origi- 
nally signed with both letters and arith- 
metical figures (e. g. fol. 16 a, ^and ^,^), but 
in most cases either the one, or the other. 



or both have disappeared. A later hand has 
erroneously numbered them from r^ to .=u . 
Leaves are wanting after foll.1,42, 43, 51, and 
73. Each page is divided into two columns, 
of from 23 to 26 lines. This manuscript 
is written in a good, regular, though by no 
means elegant Estrangela, and dated A. Gr. 
785, A.D. 474. Fol. 7 is a later insertion, 
of about the ix''' cent. It contains — 

The first part of the works of Aphraatea.

portion remains, fol. 2 a.

On fol. 99 b there is a note, written by 
the scribe in a more cursive character, which 
states that this book was purchased by ,iao 
>x*iia {Movi/MXi?), priest of the church in the 

village of K'iuaL^i^ (perhaps ^j^ , near 
Damascus, on the road to Hims), in the year 
785 (A.D. 474), when Timotheus was bishop 
of that place and Monimus was periodeutes. 
The book itself was written in Edessa.

almost illegible Syriac note of comparatively 
modem date, and one or two ornamental 
designs in black ink.

DXXX. 

. . Vellum, about 9| in. by 8^, consisting of 



76 leaves (Add. 17,182, foil. 100—175), a 
few of which are slightly stained and torn, 
especially foU. 100—102 and 173—176. The 
quires were once probably 12 in number ; of 
these the first two are lost, and the third is 
imperfect, a leaf being missing after fol. 105. 
The margins have been so closely cut that 
the original signatures are no longer extant. 
Each page is divided into two columns, of 
from 30 to 40 lines. This manuscript is 
written in a fine, regular Estrangela, and 
dated A. Gr. 823, A.D. 512. It contains— 
The second part of the works of Aphra- 
ates ; viz. homilies ii — xxii, and the treatise 
on " the Cluster." The K'^ioi^i K'<k.<XM^

Vellum, about 10^ in. by 6J, consisting of 
50 leaves, many of which are much stained 
and' torn, especially foU. 2, 4, 7, 8, 11, 18 — 
21, 30, 38, 39, 44, 45, and 48—50. The 
quires are signed with letters, but only one 
of them {\», fol. 30) is complete, leaves 
being wanting at the beginning, as well as 
after foil. 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 9, 10, 14, 20, 21, 23, 
24, 27, 39, 42, 46, and 47. Each page is 
divided into two columns, of from 27 to 32 
lines. The writing is a good, regular Estran- 
gela. This volume seems to be dated A. Gr. 
910, A.D. 599, and contains — 

The commentary of Athanasius of Alex- 
andria on the Psalms, r^'ioMvso.i x'nx.ftft 
coci»vaih\r< r^n^.i^.i (Expositiones in Psalmos, 
Opera, ed. 1698, t. i., p. 1009 etc. ; Migne, 
Patrologise Cursus Completus, Series Grseca, 
t. xxvii., col. 59 etc.). The Syriac text is 
often much shorter than the Greek. The 
following are the Psalms that remain, most 
of them being more or less imperfect : xvii., 
xxi. — XXV., xxxiv., xxxv., xxxix. — xii., xlvii., 
xlviii., Ivii., Iviii., Ixvii., Ixviii., Ixx. — Ixxii., 
Ixxiv. — Ixxvi., Ixxxviii., xciii., c. — cviii., ex.

THEOLOGY. 



On fol. 50 b there is a note, which, besides 
being stained and torn, has twice suffered 
alteration and erasure. Of the original 
writing we can read, in the first and second 
lines, the words : tt^<yi\-i

and below : Ktolri".-! r<A<an i\ pi

which show that the book was purchased 
by, and in all likelihood written for, certain 
persons in the year 910, A.D. 599. The next 
owner was a priest, whose name is now 
effaced, for in the fourth line we read, in a 
different hand, the words (sic) >Mjio rd&^u 
v^jiixn K'etApS'. The third possessor was 
Isaac bar Abraham bar Dinara of Tagrit, 
from whose hands the manuscript passed 
into the library of the convent of S. Mary 
Deipara, A.D. 932 : r<LaAu^ ,cn[oAv_.»<']

DXXXII. 

Vellimi, about 10| in. by 7|, consisting of 
69 leaves, several of which are slightly 
soiled, the first being also torn. The quires, 
signed with letters, are now 7 in number. 
There are from 26 to 33 lines in each page, 
This volume is written in a peculiar, rather 
cursive hand, of about the viii* cent. It 
contains — 

The Festal Letters of Athanasius, rCi^'-ii^r^ 

joOaSia^h\r^ >T=>a r^z.3.Ta.-l K'livu.irEll^k., preceded 

by a chronological introduction, foil. 1 h — 
10 a. Of the letters only twenty remain, the 
last of which is imperfect. 

These letters were printed by Dr. Cureton 
in the order of their discovery, London, 1848 ; 



and re-edited, in correct sequence and with 
a Latin translation, by Cardinal Mai in his 
Nova Patrum Bibliotheca, torn. vi. (see also 
Migne, Patrol. Cursus Complet., Ser. Grseca, 
t. ii. col. 1339, etc.). They were translated 
into German by Dr. Larsow, Leipzig, 1852 ; 
and into English by Dr. Burgess, in Dr. 
Pusey's Library of Fathers of the Holy 
Catholic Church, 1854, where the two 
leaves (foil. 41 and 48) are printed, which 
were added to the manuscript since the 
appearance of the Curetonian text. 

On fol. 1 a there is written in large, open 
characters, a note stating that the book be- 
longed to the convent of S. Mary Deipara : 

it.'iLn ju»XJi K^i^il rdicn r<^^ ,cnoiui^ 

r^VD.l Aa Oil I \ I hoortf'.i r^'ins-saai K'eolr^ 

From a note on the margin of fol. 1 6 it 
appears that a history of the blessed Virgin 
and a life of Simeon Stylites (Add. 14,484 ?) 
were at one time bound with these letters. 

On the same page a poor monk named 
Jacob has recorded his inability to under- 
stand the introduction in these words :

Vellum, about 9 in. by 5f , consisting of 
52 leaves, two of which, foil. 15 and 45, are 
slightly torn. The quires are 7 in number, 
the last of which is imperfect, a leaf being 



wanting after fol. 45. 



What the original 



signatures were, is not apparent ; at a com- 
paratively recent period, they have been 
signed with letters from .%. to v\ . Each page 

is divided into two columns, of from 28 to 



EPHRAIM.

DXXXIV. 

Vellum, about 9§ in. by 5|, consisting of 
16 leaves, several of which are much stained 
and torn, especially foil. 1, 7, and 16. The 
number and signatures of the quires cannot 
now be ascertained. Leaves are wanting 
after foU. 6, 7, 8, 9, 14, 15, and 16. There 
are from 29 to 33 lines in each page. This 
manuscript is written in a fine, Edessene 
hand of the v'*" or vi* cent., and contains — 
Homilies on different subjects by Ephraim, 
The title, fol. 1 b, has been effaced, and in 
its place we now read the following mutUated 
words, written by a later hand : »i]so3 
ore' .oi»\\tQflL3l rd\r^ (sic) "uvx. . . . pa<i&[rc' 
.fttiUr^fluA ; which seem to imply that the 



writer ascribed these homilies, not to 
Ephraim, but to Basil or John Cluysostom. 
However, on fol. 9 a we can still read the 
partially effaced running title >«i&r^ .isB.i ; 
and again, on foil, 12 b and 13 a, r^:3a\io^ 
^Lii&re' tisa.i; besides (sic) >*i& .iso.i on 
the margin of fol, 2 a in a later hand. 
The several homilies are — 

1. On the Miracles wrought by Moses in 
Egypt, :v=i^,i r^h\ailir^ 1a. rdt.aa.v> r^iaardsa

Yellum, about 10| in, by 8, consisting of

which are slightly torn. The original sig-

from 34 to 38 lines. This manuscript is 
written in a fine, regular Estrangela of the 
ri"' cent., and contains — 
. A portion of the discourses of Ephraim 
against false doctrines, addressed to Hy- 
patius. Title, fol. 1 b : ,isjo.i rc'4»H[^^] 

The words r<'i<oi\f<' A^ ^tal'oo.i would 
appear to imply that there were 22 of 
these discourses, each commencing with a 
letter of the alphabet, in the usual order, 
like those of Aphraates (Add. 14,619 and 
17,182) ; but this seems unlikely, as the 
second discourse begins with the letter ^ 
(iu-Kiovsi) . Besides, there is no mention 
of alphabetical arrangement in Add. 14,570. 
The running title, e.g. fol. 4 b, is simply

The rest of this manuscript still exists as

been erased, and the other merely contains

DXXXYI. 

Vellum, about llf in. by 8f, consisting 
of 14 leaves (Add. 14,574, foil. 20—33), aU 
of which are more or less stained and torn. 
Each page is divided into three columns, of 
from 32 to 38 lines. The writing is a good, 
regular Estrangela of the v*^ or vi"" cent. 

These leaves are all that remain of a 
volume which once comprised a great part 
of the metrical works of Ephraim, and in 
which the madrashe were numbered with 
arithmetical figures. Erom the mutilated 
colophon and the running title r^^^^ Aj^..! 
(fol. 23 6), it appears that the manuscript 
originally contained 160 discourses on the 
Church, the Mysteries of our Lord, Vir- 
ginity, and against Heresies (see Assemani, 
Bibl. Orient., t. i., pp. 86, 92 and 118).

DXXXVII. 

Vellimi, about 12f in. by 9|, consisting 
of 51 leaves, some of which are much 
stained, and two, foil. 45 and 51, much torn. 
The quires are signed with letters. Leaves 
are wanting after foU. 19, 42, 48 and 50. 
Each page is divided into three columns, of 
from 40 to 77 lines. The writing, which 
is small and neat, though not very regular, 
is evidently that of an Edessene scribe of the 
V* or vi*'^ cent. The first three pages are in 
a different hand of somewhat later date. 
This volume contains — 

Part of the metrical works of Ephraim ; 
viz.

sometimes even in the division of the hymns.

The ancient note, which followed this colo-

was written another, stating that the volimie 
belonged to the convent of S. Mary Deipara,

A third note, on the same page, referring to 
some person or persons from the city of

Three vellum leaves, about 13^ in. by 10, 
all slightly stained and torn (Add. 14,635, 
foil. 16 — 18). There are three columns, of 
from 38 to 42 lines, in each page. The 
writing is a good, regular Estrangela of the

If fol. 18 really belongs to the same manu- 
script as foil. 16 and 17, these leaves are all

stained with oil, and some of them much 
torn, especially foil. 1, 12, 13, and 41—44. 
The original signatures of the quires are no 
longer apparent. The volume is imperfect 
both at the beginning and the end. Each 
page is divided into two columns, of from 40

elegant Estrangela, probably of the v* 
cent., and contains — 

Part of the works of Basil of Csesarea; 
viz.

lies on the Six Days of Creation, t^H-ssr^ia 
r^^cu A^AuL. l^s (see Opera, Paris, 1839,

a. A small portion of horn. vii. Eol. 1 a. 

b. Hom. viii. Eol. 1 6. 

c. Hom. ix. ; slightly imperfect at the end. 
Eol. 7 a. 

2. The treatise on the Holy Spirit (see 
Opera, Paris, 1839, t. iii. p. 1 ; Migne, Patrol. 
Gr., t. xxxii., col. 67). Eol. 12 a. It is slightly 
imperfect at the beginning and towards the 
end. The title is mutUated, but the sub- 
scription, fol. 44 a, runs thus : . >_Ljt.

Whether fol. 49 really belongs to this

and soiled, that the writing upon it is no 
longer legible.

figures (see, for example, foil. 14 b and 15 a). 
A single leaf is wanting after fol. 6. Each

they ploughed (vrj.i.T = ,""ij3."!.i), the quill of a 
bird; who toiled (,rdl = ,red), in reliance 
on Thee, under the yoke of Thy doctrine.

A long note, in a more cursive character, 
on fol. 94 a, ioforms us that the manuscript 
was written in the year 820 (A.D. 509), in 
the (Arabian) convent of icu^^ , when 
Thomas was abbat, at the expense of the 
deacon and ceconomus Simeon. A » < ^ -,

Another note on the same page, in minute 
cursive characters (see Land, Anecd. Syr.,

the scribe was Jacob of Amid (?), and offers 
up prayers for Malchus, Leontius, from a 
place called reA^Tu (?) on Mount Lebanon, 
and Alphseus (ia3u»), also from Mount Le- 
banon. In this note the diacritical points of 
the letters .i and i are usually omitted, and 
the letter sso often takes the form 9 , which 
is not uncommon in manuscripts of various

VeUum, about 11;^ in. by 8, consisting of 
206 leaves, a few of whicb, near the end, are 
slightly stained and torn. The quires are 
numbered throughout with letters, but this 
must have been done, in part at least, by a 
later hand, as the 10* is also signed with 
the letter re", and the next four with the 
arithmetical figures yu j Z'/ > yi/^ and ^ . 
The quires .=» , .\_and .i are marked on the 
last leaf with the Coptic ciphers O^, \/~^ 
and <i) . The manuscript is not aU the work 
of one hand. EoU. 1 — 42 are written in a 
neat cursive character. On fol. 43 a, the 
second scribe began also to write a cursive 
hand, but almost immediately changed it 
to Estrangela (fol. 43 b), which he con- 
tinued as far as fol. 139, reverting then 
to the cursive. Greek vowels have been 
occasionally added by later hands. Each 
page is divided into two columns, but the 
number of lines in each column varies 
very considerably. It is dated A. Gr. 1156, 
A.D. 845, and contains — 

The first volume of the works of Gregory 
TheologusofNazianzus; re'Ausa.To f^^n \\ <\ 

translated into Syriac by the abbat Paul, 
in the island of Cyprus, A. Gr. 935, A.D.

The margins of this manuscript are 
covered with notes, in the same hand- 
writings as the text, which are probably 
due either to the translator Paul or to 
the patriarch Athanasius II. Many of them 
are either various readings (see in particular 
fol. 147 b), or references to Scripture; but 
others relate to the occasions of the sermons, 
or are explanatory of words or passages in 
them. For example —

After the usual doxology, fol. 226 b, we 
find the name of the scribe, Abraham of 
Beth-Siiraya : yicoxar^ 1^ red jj K'is.i A& 
ws^.t (<l*io^ iua.i r^\ T*»iT*w . A subse- 
quent note, of later date, has been erased, 
with the exception of the words ,caaiur^ 
r<ico r«l=>Auk ; and an Arabic note on fol. 1 a 
has suffered the same fate. 

On the margins of this manuscript, as on 
those of the preceding, there are written a 
considerable number of notes, and words in 
Greek characters. 

This seems to be the third codex men- 
tioned by Assemani in the Bibl. Orient., 
t. iii., pars, i., p. 23 ; though, if such be the 
case, his description of it is rather inaccu- 
rate.

"Thomas, from the holy convent of the 
monks of Kellat,* collated this book. Let 
every one who reads, pray for him: 'May 
God have mercy on him.' " 

The margins of this manuscript are covered 
with notes, and words written in Greek cha- 
racters, some of which have been added by 
later hands (see, for example, foil. 12 a and 
b, 14 a, 15 b, 41 a, etc.). Extracts from the 
writings of Severus of Antioch are given on 
foil. 37 a, 71 a (letter to Csesaria), 73 a, 152 b 
{r^\\os>i \\si), and 174 b (letter to Isidorus 
Comes). This last has the name of the 
patriarch Athanasius II., j»cuAui>re', at-

The margins of this manuscript are even

At the top of fol. 187 h we read the words :

These are followed by a long note, the 
first line of which has undergone two succes-

the remainder it appears that the name of the

At the foot of the page there was another

which has been purposely erased. The few

rently a mere trial of the pen : oAm* A^

On fol. 1 a there is a note, in the usual 
form, stating that this was one of the 250 
volumes, brought to the convent of S. Mary 
Deipara by the abbat Moses of Nisibis, A. Gr. 
1243, A.D. 932. On the verso of the same 
leaf is written the name of CT€<l>ANOC, 
and the word Theologus, once in Greek, 
eEouAourO[C], and twice in Syriac. 

This manuscript was one of those seen and 
coveted by Assemani, when he was at the 
convent of S. Mary Deipara. See the Bibl. 
Orient., t. i., p. 172, and t. iii., pars i., p. 23.

108 leaves, the first and last of which are 
slightly stained and torn. The quires, 11 in 
number, are signed with letters from .ta to 
."li . There is a lacuna after fol. 102. The 
number of lines in each page varies from 29 
to 36. This manuscript is written in a small, 
neat character of about the ix*'^ cent., with 
occasional Syriac vowels. Fol. 1 is of some- 
what later date. It contains — 

The second part of the works of Gregory 
Nazianzen, oocuio^i^ r^AuiMri" rc'i\o^a , 
comprising 12 discourses. The translation 
is different from that of the abbat Paul, and 
may probably be the older Nestorian version 
(see Assemani, Bibl. Or., t. iii., pars i., p. 24, 
note 1). The handwriting and general 
appearance of the manuscript are in favour 
of this supposition.

There are many marginal notes in this

ings or explanatory of difficult words. 

Fol. 1 a exhibits a list (kI^.icu;.) of the 
above discourses, underneath which are the 
letters O PP. 

On the margin of fol. 10 a, there is a note, 
stating that the deacon Severus sent this 
volume to Michael the patriarch (of Antioch), 
probably the first of the name. Consequently 
the date of the present lies between A.D. 1167 

and 1200. . paxsa r^'iar^Jio . r^ca K^aixA i.Ti.

124 leaves, some of which are much stained 
and otherwise slightly damaged, especially 
foU. 1—18, 108, and 120—124. The quires, 
signed with letters, were originally at least 
14 in number ; but leaves are now wanting 
both at the beginning and end, as well as 
after foil. 2, 3, and 120. Each page is 
divided into two columns, of from 32 to 41 
lines. This volume is written in a small, 
regular hand of the vi"* or vii*"* cent., and 
contains — 

Ifiscourses of Gregory Nazianzen, in a 
translation different from that of the abbat 
Paul, but, judging by nos. 3, 4, 5, and 17, 
identical with that contained in Add. 18,815. 
There is, however, nothing distinctively Nes-

A Commentary on the works of Gregory 
Nazianzen, as translated into Syriac by the

the commentary, whence it was taken, 
was compiled by E-ahban Benjamin and 
his school, and revised and corrected by one 
of his disciples, Daniel. The text, which 
seems to be corrupt in some passages, is as

Though the author, or rather compiler, of 
these scholia is, so far as we have observed, 
nowhere expressly named, yet there are pas- 
sages which show that he was a contemporary 
and friend of Athanasius II. (Baladensis), 
patriarch of the Jacobites. For example, 
fol. 132 a, commenting on horn. ii. § 13 
(Opera, t. l., p. 18, UpSixov fiev Btj tovto, mv 
etiro/iev, evKa^ela-dat, a^iov, k.t.X.), he says : 
rf.icn p3 (sic) ^xsar<^ ,A.r«' ps ^so )au>ol 

003 Ar^^ r^-l^^r^ . r<'<iu=)9.i cn^rii n> ocp ^i 

Bar-Hebrseus teUs us that the works of Gre- 
gory were translated, during the lifetime of 
Athanasius, by the famous Jacob of Edessa 
(Assemani,Bibl.Or.,t. ii., p. 307; t. iii., pars i., 
p. 23, note) ; and it is probable that 
our commentator is the almost equally 
celebrated George, bishop of the Arabs, who 
was consecrated at the express desire of 
Athanasius (Assemani, Bibl. Or., t. ii., p. 336, 
no. 10). This guess receives some support 
from the fact of the name ^i^ior<l_\^ 
(<.sa-ia.-^.i being written on the margin 
of fol. 132 b, opposite another passage in 
which the commentator speaks in the first 
person: isar^ mLi rdA&cuao Ar< ^.1 ^i^

U.O 



If George, bishop of the Arabs, be really 



the author or compiler of these scholia, he 
may have taken the scholia of Aitallaha (fol. 
102 b) and of Daniel (fol. 103 a) from the 
older, Nestorian, version of Gregory Nazian- 
zen (see Assemani, Bibl. Or., t. ii., p. 307 ; 
t. iii., pars i., p. 23, note). Daniel is cited

are the letters H. PP.

At the foot of the page is a deed of gift, 

by which one Abi (or Ubai, ^j\?), the son 
of Saliba, of Tagrit, gave this book, together 
with a copy of the Acts and the Pauline 
Epistles, [to his daughter Sara, A. H. 273,

On fol. 2 a we find an extract, written in 
a good Estrangela of about the viii"* cent.,

As these leaves follow one another consecu- 
tively, without any lacunae, it is clear that 
the original order has not heen disturbed 
since they were deposited in the British 
Museum. The Syriac text has, however, 
been washed off, to facilitate the reading of 
more ancient palimpsest texts, so that only 
fol. 9 now remains in its original condition. A 
transcript was made, previously to this opera- 
tion, by the late Mr. Ellis, and is now bound 
with the manuscript, and numbered foil. 
14—26. 

These leaves are remarkable for being 
doubly palimpsest. 

I. The more ancient of the two underlying 
texts exhibits portions of the Annals of the 
Roman historian Granius Licinianus, con- 
sisting of fragments of Books xxvi., xxviii., 
xxxiii. (?), XXXV., and xxxvi. Each page 
is divided into two columns of 24 lines. The 
character is an elegant, small-sized uncial of 
the vi* or vii"* cent. The writing is most 
plainly visible on foU. 1 b and 5 a. These 
fragments were edited by Dr. Karl Pertz, 
under the title of " Gai Grani Liciniani An- 
nalium quse supersunt," Berlin^ 1857; and 



re-edited at Leipzig, in 1858, under the title of 
" Grani Liciniani quae supersunt emendatiora 
edidit philologorum Bonnensium heptas." 
See also "Philologus, Zeitschrift fur das 
klassische Alterthum," for 1854, p. 394; 
"Zeitschrift fur das Gymnasialwesen" for 
1858, pp. 341 and 714; " Monatsberichte 
der Berliner Akademie der Wissenschaften" 
for 17th June, 1858; and "Transactions 
of the Royal Society of Literature," for 1859, 
new Series, vol. vi. The facsimile in Pertz's 
edition is indifferent. 

II. The work of Granius Licinianus was 
effaced in order to make room for that of a 
Latin Grammarian, which is written across 
the reversed pages in a straggling, cursive 
hand of the viii* or ix"" cent. The heading 
de adverbio is legible on fol. 1 a, at the top 
of the page; and de verbo on fol. 8 b, also 
at the top (see Pertz's preface to Granius 
Licinianus, p. iii.). The writing is most 
legible on foU. 2, 7, and 10.

There are from 30 to 33 lines in each page. 
This manuscript is written in a good, regular 
hand of about the ix*** cent., and contains — 

A Commentary on the two discourses of 
Marcus the monk on the Spiritual Law, 

T^ti-n- jttCLo'Vsa.t , apparently either that of 
Babaeus, or that of Abraham bar Dashen- 
dad, more probably the former. See Asse- 
mani, Bibl. Or., t. iii., pars 1, pp. 96 and 
194. 

Eirst discourse. Eol. 1 a. 

Second discourse. Eol, 18 a. 

The last four leaves, foil. 38 — 42, seem to 
contain a survey of the general scope and 
arrangement of the two discourses, divided 
into several chapters. 

[Add. 17,270.] 

DCYI. 

Thirteen vellum leaves, about 9f in. by 
6|, several of which are much stained, torn, 



and mutilated (Add. 17,217, foU. 20—82). 
The quires are signed with letters (fol. 27 a, 
o). There are from 31 to 37 lines in each 
page. The writing is good and regular, of 
the ix*** cent. These leaves contain — 

Portions of the Commentary of Theodore 
of Mopsuestia on the book of Genesis (see 
Migne, Patrol. Gr., t. Ixvi., coll. 633—646). 

The first or introductory discourse, K'tsar^a 
rtf'^A^i rd*=o.Ta , is imperfect at the begin- 
ning, fol. 20 a. The second discourse begins 
on fol. 23 I. Eoll. 24—30 comprise frag- 
ments of the commentary on eh, i. and ii.; 
fol. 31, of that on ch. xxii. 

The greater part of these fragments has 
been edited, with a Latin translation, by 
Dr. Sachau in his work, "Theodori Mop- 
suesteni Eragmenta Syriaca," Leipzig, 1869. 

[Add. 17,217, foU. 20—32.] 



DCYIL 

Eive vellum leaves, about 10^ in. by 6J, 
the second and third of which are much 
torn (Add. 14,668, foil. 32—36.). Each page 
is divided into two columns, of from 27 to 
29 lines. The writing is a fine, regular 
Estrangela, of the vi"* cent. They contain — 

Portions of the Commentary of Theodore 
of Mopsuestia on the twelve minor Prophets 
(see the original Greek in Mai, Scriptorum 
Veterum Nova CoUectio, t. vi., or Migne, 
Patrol. Gr., t. Ixvi., col. 124) ; viz. 

Hosea, ch. viii. 7—12, fol. 32. 

Joel, ch. i. 19 — ii. 2, fol. 33 ; and ch. ii. 
20—26, fol. 34. 

Amos : part of the introduction, fol. 35 ; 
and ch. ii. 3 — 5, fol. 36. 

These fragments have been edited by Dr. 
Sachau, with the corresponding Greek text, 
in " Theodori Mopsuesteni Eragmenta Sy- 
riaca," Leipzig, 1869.

THEODORE OF MOPSUESTIA.— CYRIL OF ALEXANDRIA. 



483 



DCVIII. 

Eighteen vellum leaves, about lOf in. by 
8|, nearly all more or less stained, torn, 
and mutilated. The quires are signed 
with letters (fol. 6 b, \). Each page is 
divided into two columns, of from 34 to 37 
lines. The writing is a small, elegant, Edes- 
sene Estrangela, of the v*"" or vi"" cent. They 
contain — 

Fragments of the treatise of Theodore of 
Mopsuestia on the Incarnation of our Lord, 
divided into 15 books.* See O. F. Fritzsche, 
de Theodori Mopsuesteni vita et scriptis 
commentatio (Halae, 1836), p. 88; Migne, 
Patrol. Gr., t. Ixvi., col. 55 ; Assemani, Bibl. 
Or., t. iii., pars 1., p. 33 ; Cave, Hist. Liter., 
t. i., p. 387. 

Whether the leaves, as now arranged, are 
in correct sequence, is very uncertain. The 
43** section, -^59 , begins on fol. 4 b ; and 
the 6"* discourse ends on fol. 6 b, with the 
subscription p^ivtrs'.i K'isop^so >Ax. . The 
50"* section, ^j , commences on fol. 7 b. On 
fol. 10 b we find the conclusion of the 8* 
discourse and the commencement of the 9*, 
comprising sections .\a> , :\ko , and enw , 
which have been subsequently altered into 
.100 , 0000 , and 000 . The 10"* discourse 
ends, and the 11*'' begins, on fol. 11 b. On 
fol. 12 b there is also the running title 
iorb^.TM^i ri'iaireisa . The 78* and 79'" sec- 
tions appear on fol. 17 b. 

These fragments have been edited, with a 
Latin translation, by Dr. Sachau, in " Theo- 
dori Mopsuesteni Fragmenta Syriaca," Leip- 
zig, 1869. 

Fol. 8 has been used in binding a volume 
of the discourses of Jacob of Batnae, as 
appears from the titles written on the verso : 

• The Greek title seems to have been Ilcpt havOpai- 
Trrjcriiiys Tov viov Tov 0toS Xoyoi it ; that of the Syriac trans-

44 leaves, many of which are much stained 
and torn, especiaUy foil. 12, 13, 15, 16, 18, 
20, 21, and 33 — 37. The quires seem origi- 
nally to have been 17 in number, and to 
have been signed with both letters and arith- 
metical figures (see fol. 38 a, apparently 
^*^). At present, many are lost, and 
scarcely one of those that remain is com- 
plete. Each page is divided into three 
columns, of from 36 to 42 lines. This 
volume is written in a good, current hand of 
the vi"* or vii*"" cent., and contains —

bably in the translation of Moses of Agel

The writing on foil. 1 and 2 a has been 
almost completely effaced, in order to make 
room for some prayers in the Coptic lan-

the arrangement of the scholia, Phocas con- 
cludes his own preface with the following 
words, introducing two lengthy extracts from

Another note on the same page, of some-

purchased by three brothers, the priest Taba, 
BasU, bishop of Bagdad,* and Paul, and 
their sister's son the priest Mark, who gave 
it and other books in a present (pcAx^ioa)

On fol. 177 « there is a third note, record- 
ing that this book belonged to a priest 
named George, who had it in a present from 
the niece of the deceased Abraham, patriarch 
of Egypt. As Ephraim or Abraham, patriarch 
of Alexandria, was consecrated A.D. 977, and 
died between three and four years after (see 
Le Quien, Or. Christ., t. ii., col. 479; Re- 
naudot, Hist. Patr. Alexandr. Jacob., p. 366), 



* Probably Lazarus bar Sabta, or Philoxenus, who was 
deposed A. Gr. 1140, A.D. 829. See Assemani, Bibl. Or., 
t. ii., pp. 123, 346 ; Le Quien, Or. Christ., t. ii., col. 1571.

195 leaves, a few of which, at the beginning 



and end, are slightly stained and torn. The 
quires are signed with letters. Each page 
is divided into two columns, of from 27 to 
32 lines. The writing is good and regular, 
the notes being in a smaller and more cursive 
character. Eol. 88 is in a different hand, 
having been added at a somewhat later 
period to supply the place of a lost leaf; 
and fol. 1, which is much mutilated, is of

volumes, was written for a monk- named 
George, a native of the village called Kephar- 
Hun, near Edessa. These books were trans- 
cribed in the year of the Greeks 1148, A.D. 
837, at the village of Turlaha, in the pro- 
vince of Antioch, in the district of Beth- 
Maiya, near the convent of Pesilta (or the 
Quarry), during the time when Dionysius* 
was patriarch of Antioch and Joseph! of 
Alexandria, and when " our master of the 
dogma. Mar Benjamin, was living in retire- 
ment in the great monastery of Tell-'ada (or 
Teleda), which is situated in the province of 
Antioch, he and the school that was with 
him and in his presence." K'i— a— »r^-A

Eoll. 248 — 251 are in a more recent hand- 
writing than any other portion of the volume. 
They contain the latter part of no. 5, and 
the first seven epistles; and were intended 
to supply what, from an accidental mis- 
arrangement of the leaves, was supposed to 
be a lacuna in the manuscript. 

Fol. 252 is a single mutUated leaf from a 
small Nestorian Service-book. 

On fol. 1 a we read the words . °> no

one time belonged to the church of the blessed 
Virgin and the Resurrection at Jerusalem.

DCXXXII. 

Vellum, consisting of 88 leaves, some of 
which are slightly stained and torn. The 
quires, signed with letters, were originally 
at least 16 in number (ea. , fol. 71). Leaves 
are wanting both at the beginning and end, 
as well as after foil. 6, 14, 32, 40, and 80. 
The number of lines in each page varies from 
20 to 24. This manuscript is written in a 
fine Estrangela of the vii"' cent. ; with the 
exception of foil. 1 — 6 and 23 — 32, which are 
later palimpsest additions of the ix'** or x"' 
century. It contains — 

The metrical discourse of Jacob of Batnae 
on the Crucifixion of our Lord. Of the 
subdivisions there are marked on the margin,

The palimpsest portions of this volume 
originally formed part of a manuscript written 
in three columns, in a small, elegant Estran- 
gela of the vi'*" cent. The older text is now 
most distinctly legible on foil. 27 and 28. 
Judging by the running title tt->ica_sooo 
oooQo&rc^.i , which is still visible on foil. 30 a 
and 26 b, at the foot of the page, this manu- 
script contained, among other things, the Acts 



of one of the Councils of Ephesus. It also 
comprised the Anakephalaeosis of Epipha- 
nius ; at least there is written on foil. 24 b 
and 29 a, in slanting Greek uncials of later 
date, the same list of heretical sects that we 
find appended to that work in Add. 12,166, 
fol. 137 a.

and 75. The quires, signed with letters, 
seem to have been 10 in nvimber, but of 
these o is lost, and several others are im- 
perfect, leaves being missing at the begin- 
ning, as well as after foil. 6, 7, 13, 64, 71 
and 73. There are from 20 to 24 lines in 
each page. This manuscript is written in a 
good, regular Estrangela of the vii"* or viii"" 
cent., and contains —

11 in number. Leaves are wanting at the 
end, as well as after foil. 26 and 100. There 
are from 16 to 20 lines in each page. This 
manuscript is written in an inelegant hand

Vellum, about 8| in. by 5|, consisting 



of 118 leaves, a few of which are slightly 
stained and torn, especially foil. 1, 35, and

once 17 in number, but the first two 
having been lost, they were re-numbered, 
also with letters. At a subsequent period, 
the next two were also lost, so that the 
last quire is now marked .^ (13). Two 
leaves are wanting after fol. 6, and one 
leaf after fol. 54. Each page is divided 
into two columns, of from 23 to 27 lines. 
This volume is written in a fine, bold Es- 
trangela, and dated A. Gr. 876, A.D. 565. It 
contains —

Then follows an extract, fol. 136 a, entitled 
.fla->io.^i.^ ti-sa.i t<'Av.t.v.T.A< , somewhat 
rudely written, but apparently by the same 
hand as the rest of the manuscript. This 
" history of Mar Gregory " is identical with 
the extract contained in Add. 14,582, fol. 
189 a. 

On fol. 135 b there is a note, stating that 
this book was presented to the convent of 
S. Mary Deipara by three persons, named 
Isaac, Daniel and Solomon (about A.D. 851 
— 59) : ^.tL>:v r^v.iA relico rclsix^ O-scn^

The remainder of this note has been care-

only one of the usual anathemas.

THEOLOGY. 



Only the answer to the first question is 
extant, and a small portion of that to the 
second. 

[Add. 17,163, foU. 1—48.] 

DCLXXIV. 

Vellum, about 10| in. by 6|, consisting 
of 38 leaves, many of which are much 
stained and torn, especially foil. 1, 2, 12 — 17, 
and 32 — 38. The quires, signed with letters, 
were originally 10 in number, but of these 
only At (fol. 19 «) and , (fol. 33 a) are now 
complete. Leaves are wanting at the begin- 
ning, as well as after foil. 2, 10, 11, 12, 13, 
14, 15, 16, 18, 29, 30, 31, and 32. There are 
from 26 to 28 lines in each page. This 
manuscript is written in a beautiful, regular 
Estrangela, and dated A. Gr., 822, A.D. 511. 
Foil. 11, 12, and 13, are in a different, 
though contemporary hand.* It contains — 

Fragments of the Commentaries of Phi- 
loxenus of Mabug on the Gospels of S. Mat- 
thew and S. Luke. 

Foil. 1 and 2 seem to belong to the Com- 
mentary on the Gospel of S. Matthew (ch. 
xviii. 21, 22) ; the remainder to that on the 
Gospel of S. Luke (from the beginning to 
ch. iii. 22). Subscription, fol. 38 6: Aur^ 

Then follows a note, stating that this 
volume was written at Mabug in the year 
822, A.D. 511, consequently some years 
before the death of the author (see Assemani, 
Bibl. Or., t. ii., p. 19).

DCLXXY. 

Vellum, about 10| in. by 6f , consisting of 
199 leaves, the first 9 of which are stained 
with oil, and foil. 9 and 199 much torn. 
The quires, signed with letters, were ori- 
ginally 24 in nvmaber (fol. 196 a, .la.), but 
the first three are lost, and the fourth is im- 
perfect. There are from 25 to 32 lines in 
each page. This volume is written in a fine, 
regular Estrangela, and belongs, like Add. 
17,126, to the first quarter of the vi*** cent. 
It contains — ■ 

The Commentary of Philoxenus of Mabug 
on select passages of the Gospels, more es- 
pecially on chap. i. 1 — 18 of the Gospel of S. 
John. 

The author combats various heresies, par- 
ticularly that of the Nestorians, whom he 
calls "the heretics of the present time." 
The following are a few examples out of 
many.

after fol. 136. Each page is divided into 
three columns, of from 37 to 44 lines. This 
manuscript is written in a beautiful Edessene 
hand of the vi**" cent., and contains —

containing, in the first part of the volume 
(foil. 1 — 43), from 40 to 45 lines; and in 
the second part (foil. 44—103), from 32 to 
38. This manuscript is written by two 
hands (foil. 1—43 and foil. 44—103) in a 
good, regular Estrangela, of the vi* and vii* 
centuries. It contained — 

The discourses of Philoxenus of Mabug on

Vellum, about llf in. by 9, consisting of 
144 leaves, some of which are much stained

144. The quires, signed with both Greek 
(Coptic) and Syriac letters, were originally 



21 in number, but of the first three only a 
single leaf remains, and there are lacunae of 
greater or less extent after foil, 20, 60, 131, 
134, 135, 137, 143, and 144. Erom the com- 
mencement as far as fol. 121, the pages are 
numbered by the hand of the scribe, the 
verso of each leaf being marked with its 
appropriate letter or letters. Each page is 
divided into two columns, of from 29 to 34 
lines. This volume is written in a good, 
regular hand of about the x**" cent., and 
originally contained — 

The discourses of Philoxenus of Mabug on 
Christian life and character. There now 
remain — 

1. A single leaf from disc. 2. Eol. 1.

This manuscript is remarkable for the 
ornaments and' illuminations at the com- 
mencement of each discourse, as weU as 
at the top of the first and last leaves of 
each quire. They are executed in the Coptic 
style, so that the manuscript must be of 
Egyptian origin, and was probably written 
in the Nitrian desert.

Vellum, about 10| in. by 6|, consisting 
of 194i leaves, some of which are much 
stained and slightly torn, especially foil. 4, 
5, and 194. The quires, signed with letters, 
are 21 in number, but the first three are 
very imperfect, leaves being wanting at the 
beginning and after foil. 4, 6, 14 and 15. 
Each page is divided into two columns, of 
from 28 to 32 lines. This manuscript is 
written in a fine, regular Estrangela, and 
dated A. Gr. 880, corresponding to the year 
617 of the era of Antioch, or A.D. 569. It 
contains — 

The second volume of the homilies {\6^oi 
e-m6p6vcot) of Severus, patriarch of Antioch, 
in a more ancient translation than that of 
Jacob of Edessa (see Add. 12,159), com- 
prising homm. xxxi. — lix. It is perhaps the 
version of Paul of Callinicus (see Assemani, 
Bibl. Or., t. ii., p. 46). The homilies are 
preceded by an index, which is imperfect at 
the beginning, but has the subscription, fol.

by one Anastasius, at the expense of the 
priest Stephen, in the year 880, corresponding 
to the year 617 of the era of Antioch (A.D. 
569), when Sergius was abbat of a convent,

effaced, enough can be read to show that he 
had it conveyed from Egypt to Syria, and

DCLXXXVII. 

The two volvunes, Add. 17,210 and 17,211 
require a double description ; viz. as separate 
Greek palimpsests and as a single Syriac 
manuscript. 

A. Add. 17,210, 
as a Greek Palimpsest. 

Vellimi, about 12 in. by 9§, consisting of 
60 leaves, some of which are much stained 
and soiled, as well as slightly torn. There 
are 33 lines in each full page. This manu- 
script is written in regular uncials of middle 
size, frequently becoming smaller at the end 
of a line. It seems to be of the v* cent. 
The accents appear to have been added by 
the scribe, and not by the later corrector. 
It contains — 

Portions of the Iliad of Homer ; viz. 

Book xii., w. 273—471. Pol. 1 a. 

Book xiii.,vv. 133—266; 333—398; 465—

These fragments have been edited, with a 
minute description of the manuscript and 
facsimiles of several pages, by the Bev. Dr. 
Cureton, and published by order of the 
Trustees of the British Museum, A.D. 1851.

B. Add. 17,211, 
as a Greek Palimpsest. 

VeUum, about 12^ in. by 9f , consisting of 
53 leaves, and made up of parts of two 
manuscripts. 

I. Poll. 1 — 48. Porty-eight leaves, some 
of which are much stained and soiled, and 
not a few more or less torn, especially foil. 
2, 11, and 14. Each page is divided into two 
columns of 25 lines. This manuscript is 
written in large uncials, frequently becoming 
smaller at the end of a line. It seems to be 
of the vi"" cent., and contains — 

Large portions of the Gospel of S. Luke, 
fol. 4 a, preceded by the KecpaXaia , fol. 1 a. 
The Ammonian sections are marked on the 
margins, but Without the addition of the 
Eusebian canons. 

These fragments have been edited, with a 
minute description of the manuscript and a 
facsimile of a portion of fol. 4 b, by Tischen- 
dorf in his Monumenta Sacra Inedita, Nova 
CoUectio, vol. ii., Leipzig, 1857. Por some 
account of the leaves which have been added 
to the volume since that time (foil. 2, 11, 
and 14), see the Journal of Sacred Literature, 
4*'^ Series, vol. iv. (1864), p. 466. 

II. Pol. 49—53. Pive leaves, about llj 
in. by 8|, all of which are more or less 



SEVERUS OF ANTIOCH.

stained and soiled. The lower half of fol. 50 
has been torn away, its place being supplied 
by part of one of the blank fly-leaves. Each 
page is divided into two columns, and 
in each full column there are 31 lines. 
These leaves are written in regular, but 
small-sized, slanting uncials, of the end of 
the vii**" or beginning of the viii* cent. They 
contain — 

Portions of the Elements of Euclid, com- 
prising propositions from Books x. and xiii. ; 
in particular, fol. 49, book x., propp. 32 and 
33 ; fol. 51, propp. 80 and 81, ^a (in Gregory's 
edition, Oxon. 1703, propp. 81 and 82) ; fol. 
52, propp. 112 and 113, |0t7(in Gregory, propp. 
113 and 114); fol. 53, book xiii., prop. 19, t^ 
(in Gregory, prop. 14). 

C. Add. 17,210—211, 
as a Syriac manuscript. 
Vellum, about 9f in. by 6, consisting of 
223 leaves, some of which are much stained 
and torn. The quires, signed with letters, 
were originally 23 in number, but the greater 
part of the first has been lost. Of these the 
first ten, and the last, are bound up in Add. 
17,211 ; the remaining twelve in Add. 
17,210. There are from 19 to 25 lines in 
each page. This manuscript is written in a 
good, regular hand, of the beginning of the 
ninth century. It contains — 

The first half of the second book of the 
treatise of Severus of Antioch against 
Joannes Grammaticus of Csesarea (see Add. 
12,157), as we learn from the colophon.

THEOLOGY. 



In Add. 17,211, fol. 53 a, lower half, there 
is a note, stating that this book was written 
by one Simeon, a recluse of the convent of 
Mar Simeon of Kartamin, for Daniel, pe- 
riodeutes of the district of Amid : .cnoiurC

In the same manuscript, on fol. 49 a, 
lower half, there is a note in a different 
hand, informing us that the book belonged 
to Daniel, bishop of Edessa, who acquired it 
whilst he was periodeutes of the district of 
Amid (see the previous note) : cn-.dv^rtf'

A third note, on the same page, in another 
hand, records that the said Daniel bequeathed 
it at his death to the convent of Mar Silas at 
Sarug: p^'-isaovA cb^iort'^.f tcnoJuj )ciAojLa

Dr. Cureton has shown, in the preface to his 
edition of the fragments of the Iliad, pp. viii. 
and ix., that this Daniel must have been 
bishop of Edessa somewhere between A.D. 
768, when Elias of Kartamin was elected to 
that see, and A.D. 825, when Theodosius 
became bishop.* 

Of the subsequent history of the volume we 
know nothing ; though Dr. Cureton has very 
plausibly conjectured that it was one of the 
250 manuscripts, which were conveyed by 
Moses of Nisibis to the convent of S. Mary 
Deipara, A.D. 932.

Vellum, about 11 in. by 7^, consisting of 
219 leaves, a few of which, especially near 
the beginning and end, are slightly stained 
and torn. The quires, signed with letters, 
were originally 23 in number, but the whole 
of the first is now lost, as well as the last 
leaf of the second. Each page is divided into 
two columns, of from 37 to 49 lines. This 
volume is written in a good, regular Estran- 
gela of the vii''' or viii"" cent., and contains —

in a fine, clear Estrangela of the vi"" cent.,

A.Gr. 899, A.D. 588. It contains— 

1. The treatise of Severus of Antioch, 
entitled rd^Acu:! K'AvAwoi* AjiacA , against 
the Additions, or Appendices, of Julian, in 
43 chapters. The translation appears to be 
that of Paul of Callinicus (see Assemani, 
Bibl. Or., t. ii., p. 46). It begins in this 
manuscript with a letter of Severus, ad- 
dressed to a person who had asked him to 
divide the treatise into chapters, fol. 1 b :

Another note on the same page states 
that these letters were translated from the 
Greek by the priest Athanasius of Nisibis, 
who dictated them to the priest Severus, at 
the request of Matthew, bishop of Aleppo,* 
and Daniel, bishop of Edessa, A. Gr. 980,

This was probably the same Athanasius 
who afterwards became patriarch of the Jaco- 
bites (A. Gr. 995). See Assemani, Bibl. Or., 
t. i., p. 493, t. ii., p. 335; Le Quien, Or. 
Christ., t. ii., col. 1364. 

A third note on the same page is too 
much stained and torn to admit of tran- 
scription.

Velliim, about 11 in. by 7f , consisting of 
148 leaves, some of which are much stained 
and torn, especially foil. 1 — 3, 52, 53, 144, 
146 and 147. The quires, signed with letters, 
were originally at least 22 in number, but 
r^, .\. , .V and CO* are lost, and .a , \ , m , 
\ and > are very imperfect. Leaves are 
wanting both at the beginning and end, as 
well as after foU. 1, 53, 55, 57, 63, 84, 144, 
145, 146 and 147. Each page is divided 
into two columns, of from 27 to 40 lines. 
This volume is written in a good, regular 
Estrangela of the viii* cent., and many 
Greek proper names and other words are 
expressed on the margins in Greek letters. 
It contains — 

The sixth book of the select epistles of 
Severus of Antioch, in the same translation 
as Add. 12,181. 

The Index of the eleven tItXoi,, or heads, 
under which the epistles are arranged, is

THEOLOGY. 



The margins of this manuscript are covered 
with glosses (K'Heoai) and various readings 
(^ , i.e. r<» **t'"^) . The former were 
mostly added by the scribe, the latter by 
readers ia the xii"* and xiii*'' centuries. One 
of the glosses is said to be taken from the 
commentator Tobiah, fol. 24 a : ^ t<'ieooj 

Toll. 1 and 2 a contain extracts in a some- 
what later hand, chiefly taken, as it appears, 
" from the book of the Paradise," r^r>i\& pa 
reaL..ii&.i (fol. 1 a).

DCXCY. 

Vellum, about 9J in. by 5|, consisting of 
149 leaves, several of which are much stained 
and torn, especially foil. 45 — 49, 52, 53, 60, 
61, 68, 70, 99, and 149. The quires, signed 
with letters, were originally 18 in number, 
of which the first two are lost, and o , i and 
M are very imperfect. Leaves are wanting 
after foU. 45, 47, 48, 50, 51, 59 and 78. The 
number of lines in each page varies from 26 
to 33. This volume is written in a good, 
Nestorian hand, with occasional Syriac 
vowels, and seems to be of the x*"" cent. 
The place of the two lost quires has been 
supplied by 17 paper leaves, written in an 
ordinary, current hand, with Greek vowels, 
of about the xiii"* cent. It contains —

On fol. 1 b there is a note, rather care- 
lessly written, stating that the manuscript 
belonged to the convent of S. Mary Deipara, 
and that the first two (paper) quires had 
been copied by one Habban Matthew, of 
Tur-'Abdln, during the time that Eabban 
Joseph was abbat, from another manuscript, 
which was then in the convent of S. Mary 
Deipara, but which had been since conveyed 
by the abbat Constantine, — the first of 
the name, not the second, — to the convent

of S. Antony, with a silver cross. He 
died there, and neither the book nor the 
cross had been restored to their rightful 
owners. It is also stated that, at the time 
when this note was written, there were many 
Syriac manuscripts in the convent of S. Paul, 
which is near that of S. Antony. This 
convent once belonged to the Syrians, but 
had subsequently been seized by the Copts.

Vellum, about 9| in. by 6^, consisting of 
178 leaves, one of which (fol. 10) is much 
torn. The quires, 19 in number, are signed 
with letters, but the last is imperfect, 
owing to the loss of at least one leaf after 
fol. 175. Each page is divided into two 
columns, of from 27 to 37 Hues. The 
writing is a good, regular Estrangela of the 
viii"" or ix"" cent., with the exception of the 
last eight leaves, which are somewhat later. 
This volume contains — 

1. The works of John, abbat of the mo- 
nastery of Mount Sinai, commonly called 
John Climacus ; viz.

The margins of this manuscript are 
covered with notes and glosses by different 
hands, among which are some various 
readings, indicated by -.=» (i. e. rt' u i»..-i , 

e.g. foil. 3 b, 72 b, 168 b, 169 b, 170 a). The 
greater part of the glosses are in Arabic, in 
a hand of about the xiii*** cent. Greek 
words occur on foil. 26 b and 42 a. Fol.

a collection of letters of Jacob of Edessa; 
viz. 

a. Part of a long letter in heptasyllabic 
metre, imperfect both at the beginning and

speaks of the opportunity aiforded him of 
showing his skill as a poet (creator, maker, 
TTOM/T???) ; and quotes a part of a letter which 
he had received (fol. 67 6), in which the writer 
says that he regards every wise man, whether 
residing far or near, whether personally 
known to him or not, as a friend, and 
consequently claims Jacob as such : Kluini.!

JACOB OF EDESSA. 



601 



letter Jacob replies to 18 questions of John, 
o) The reason of the Divine utterance in 
Gen. XV. 13. — /S) Whether it is true, as 
they say, that there was no writing and no 
letters before Moses ? This was affirmed by 
Athanasius, for the purpose of ridding the 
Church of apocryphal books (t^itYtb »<Si\^), 
even though that of Enoch had to be 
sacrificed with them; but Jacob answers 
in the negative. We might as well say, 
with Basil, that there was no wine before 
the flood. The genuineness of the book of 
Enoch is proved by its being cited by the 
apostle Jude ; and we have Jewish traditions 
to the effect that Amram taught Moses the 
Hebrew as weU as the Egyptian letters in 
Pharaoh's house. — 7) Who was the Ethiopian 
woman mentioned in Num. xii. 1 ? Not 
Zipporah, but the daughter of an Ethiopian 
king, whose city Moses besieged and cap- 
tured, when he was in Pharaoh's service, 
as is narrated in Egyptian history, fol. 115 a. 
— 8) What was the pride of Satan, on 
account of which he fell from his brightness 
and became dark? What was the envy- 
wherewith he envied? and if the time be 
known when he suffered thus ? — e) How 
we should understand Job, ch. ii. 6? and 
whether Moses wrote the book of Job? 
. (<'^.i^.i r^Aa\=ao K'^coar^ ^ ^iLu r^.i&ca 
s") What are Behemoth (A>ajsacnsj) , the 
bird called ^imht. >^i^ (Job xxxix. 13), 
and Leviathan (...AucA) ? Behemoth means 
in Hebrew t^^oIm ; ^•"■^» i^i^ , r^^i^ 
rt'Av M 1 1 T. ; and Leviathan, rdxjj^ , i. e. 
r<=i\ r^cLu . The Behemoth are locusts, 
t^-soo ; Leviathan is /c^to? , and applicable 
metaphorically to Satan ; the ^i.unT ■ >«\'i\ is 
an Indian bird, called the r^L^ ia- or 
" elephant-bird," because it carries off and 
devours young elephants. — f) Wlio was the 
Zacharias mentioned ia Matth. xxiii. 35, 
Luke xi. 51 ? and why was he put to death ? 



According to Jacob, he was Zacharias the 
father of John the Baptist. — 7) Whether the 
son of the widow of Zarephath (1 Kings 
xvii. 17 — 24) was Jonah the prophet? 
whether Tiglath-pileser, the king of the 
Assyrians, was king of Nineveh in the 
time of Jonah ? and which is the correct 
reading in Jonah iii. 4, 40 days or 3 
days ? The first question is answered in the 
negative, the only authority for the statement 
being^ the " Lives of the Prophets," falsely 
ascribed to Epiphanius, K'.icn ,od r^-a^^ 

.ooai^cia.i r^AQ.noaiApt'; the second Jacob 

leaves undecided, though he thinks it pro- 
bable ; as to the third, he prefers the reading 
of the LXX., ert Tpe« i)iiApai. . — 0) What 
are the wild gourds mentioned in 2 Kings 
iv. 39 ? — ') Obadiah the prophet was pro- 
bably the third captain of fifty, 2 Kings i. 13, 
and the husband of the widow, 2 Kings iv. 1. 
— la) The articles carried away from the 
temple by the Babylonians, as narrated ia 
2 Kings, were those made by Solomon. The 
ark, altar, golden table, etc., made by Moses, 
which had been carefully stored up since the 
time of Solomon, were conveyed away 
secretly by Jeremiah during the siege, and 
deposited in the cave on mount Nebo, where 
Moses was buried, the site of which is im- 
known. This is what is meant in the epistle 
of Baruch by the words ^r^ cua^o cm^r^ 

r^x^xja rdir^M po (compare de Lagarde's 
Libri vet. Test, apocryphi, p. 89, line 17). — 
t/9) Of the rock that emitted water, rd&rd^ 
rdxJSQ Axoco rd>.iisa:i , Jacob declines to 

speak; but answers John's question regarding 
Zeruiah the mother of Joab, Abishai and 
Asahel, and Abigail the mother of Amasa, 
the son of Jether. — ^7) The Psalms were 
not all written by David ; some were com- 
posed by the sons of Korah, viz. Asaph, 
4 H

Ethan and Heman ; others by Moses, Jere- 
miah, Solomon, Jeduthun, etc. — tS) Whether 
the Jews were called Hebrews (rd*'ia^) 
from Eber (-it^ar^^) ? and whether Hebrew 
is the primeval language ? Both questions 
are answered in the affirmative. Eegarding 
the former Jacob says : oooo ^cnsoivxsQo

the antiquity of Hebrew, as compared with 
Syriac or Aramaic, he cites the opiaion 
of Clement, the disciple of S. Peter, and of 
Eusebius of Emesa. One of his principal 
arguments is derived from Gen. ii. 23 

(T:hii, TV^ti, correctly transcribed jur^, r^tre).

only two daughters and two sons-in-law, and 
no one else akin to him in Sodom save his 
wife. This letter has been published in the

who composed the Kukite hymns, n n 'b .i 

and whether he was Jacob (Baradaeus) of 
Pesilta, K'ivLflaaa ? The answer is, that the 
said hymns were not composed by any person 
of the name of Jacob, but by the deacon 



Simeon, a potter by trade, of the village of 
Gashir, in the time of Xenaias of Mabug :

i_»x,r«:^ rCAuias niLx-eo ^r«^ . — /8) The

of Bethany; to whom also belonged the 
ass on which our Lord rode into Jerusalem,

Having spoken of Candace as "queen of 
Sheba " (rda_x-) , instead of " queen of the

Antioch when Peter the Puller was patriarch, 
during the Nestorian disputes, and preached 
against that sect, taking his text from a

had asked John, why the Jews worshipped

is ridiculous, says Jacob, for both the Jews 
and the Mohammedans (p^H.\oaso) worship, 
not towards any particular quarter of the 
heavens, but towards Jerusalem and the 
Ka'ba (r^A. -. v *.) . The man should have 
asked, towards what direction the Jews 
worsliipped in the tabernacle of Moses and 
the temple of Solomon, viz. towards the 
west. So also did our Saviour, ^eta_La_3

hnes in each page. This manuscript is im- 
perfect both at the beginning and end, and 
there are lacunse after foil. 26, 27, 33, 43, and 
44. It is written in a good, regular hand of 
the ix*^ or x* cent., and contains — 

Portions of a monophysite treatise on the 
doctrine of the Two Natujes in Christ. 
As it is directed against Leo, bishop of 
Harran, and is divided into twelve chapters, 
there can be no doubt that it is the 
"Epistola Apologetica ad Leonem" of 
Elias, patriarch of Antioch, described by

DCCXIII. 

Paper, about 14^ in. by 8|, consisting of 
221 leaves, many of which are much torn, 
especially foil. 1—3, 151, and 187—221. 
The first part of the volume, foil. 1 — 164, was 
composed of 15 quires, the first of which is 
lost, and the second imperfect. They are 
signed with Coptic arithmetical figures as 
far as the tenth (I, fol. 93 a), but from that 
place with Syriac letters. The second part, 
foil. 165 — 221, is very imperfect, but pro- 
bably contained about a dozen quires, signed 
with letters (\, fol. 217 a). Each page is 
divided into two columns, of from 30 to 38 
lines. This manuscript is written in a good, 
regular hand, probably of the x*^ cent, (see 
Add. 14,683), and contains — 

A commentary on the Gospels of S. John, 
fol. 1 a, and S. Mark, fol. 165 a, compiled 
and written, according to the subscription, 
fol. 164 a, by Harith bar Sisin, of Sanbat * 
and of Harran (see, however. Add. 14,682). 

a. Of the commentary on S. John, the 
introduction and part of the first chapter are 
lost, the text commencing with ch. i. 15. 
Fol. 1 a. 

b. Of the introduction to S. Mark, fol. 
165 a, a leaf is wanting at the beginning and 
another after fol. 173. There is a considerable 
lacuna after fol. 197, and the remainder of 
the manuscript, from fol. 204 onwards, is 
very fragmentary.

According to these statements, the author 
of this commentary was Harith bar Sisin, and 
"we have here the autograph manuscript of 
the work. The volume has, however, no 
appearance of being an author's autograph ; 
and a reference to Add. 14,683, renders it 
exceedingly probable that the said Harith 
was merely the copyist, and that he has 
claimed as his own the labours of Lazarus of 
Beth-Kandasa (see also Add. 18, 295, fol.149 b) .

141 leaves, many of which are much stained 
and torn, especially foil. 94, 95, 103 — 110, 
and 140. The quires were originally 24 in 



number ; viz. 12 in the first pa,rt, foil. 1 — 
102, of which the 3"*, 4* and 6"* are missing; 
and 12 in the second part, foil. 103 — 141, of 
which the first 8 are lost and the 9"' is im- 
perfect. In the first part they are signed 
with Syriac and Greek letters; in the second, 
with Greek letters and Coptic arithmetical 
figures. The number of lines in each page 
varies from 22 to 28. This volume is written 
in a good, regular hand of the x"" cent, (see 
below), and contains —

by Dr., Cureton in the preface to his Eestal 
Letters of Athanasius, 1848, pp. xxi — xxvi. 
A facsimile of it (rather too highly coloured) 
may be found in Land's Anecdota Syriaca, 
t. i., tab. iv., and specimens from the body 
of the work in tab. ii. 4, and prefixed to 
Lee's edition of the Theophania. 

On fol. 1 a there is some Arabic and 
Syriac writing of different dates, but of no 

importance; e.g. ^f^\ ^^'^l cjjiUJl |»-*j 

JJic Jli l^yA*!lj iJjb 2 ^^j\d UjjJl !1 o>=-ljll

DCCXXYII. 

Vellum, about 9| in. by 6§, consisting 
of 174 leaves (Add. 12,175, foU. 81—254). 
The quires, 17 in number, are signed with 
letters, originally from x^ to A , but now 
from rf to OA . A few of the leaves are 
much stained and slightly torn, and the ink 
is occasionally so faded that some passages 
have been retouched by a later hand, for 
example, foil. 81 h and 200 a. The first 
quire is imperfect at the beginning. Each 
page is divided into two columns, of from 
32 to 68 lines. This manuscript is written 

• Or perhaps the word ^oAivjct^, like the Arabic 
'^^A , may merely signify that the quotation is ended.

The writing on fol. 254 b is much effaced, 
in part intentionally. At the top of the 
first column stands a short index to the 
contents of the volume, ending with the 
words on 1^ .ttu ,vs»3.i K'ixi\p<to . Then 
follows a note containing the date, which 
runs nearly as follows : ;n \h\ — [-».f<j

Hence it seems probable that the ma- 
nuscript was written A. Gr. 845, A.D. 534, 
when Timothy III., who died in the follow- 
ing year, was patriarch of Alexandria 
(see Benaudot, Hist. Patr. Alexandi-in. 
Jacob., p. 131 ; Le Qmen, Oriens Christ., 
t. ii., col. 428; and compare Cureton, 
Corpus Ignat., p. xxix.). The remain- 
ing notes appear to contain the names 
of the scribe and of the person for whom, 
or at whose expense, the book was written ; 
but neither can now be clearly deciphered. 
In the second column there is the fol-

On fol. 254 a stands a more modem note, 
of the X* or xi'" cent., four lines of which 
have been purposely erased. Judging by 
what remains, the book belonged at this time

In the second column of the same page 
there is a note, in a different hand, the first 
five lines of which have been carefully 
erased. Erom it we learn that the volume 
was presented by the deaconess redij^, of 
Beth-Mana, to a certain convent, in the year 
873, A.D. 562, at the time when the priest 
Bacchus, of > \ m \^, was ceconomus, the 
priest Aziz librarian, and the priest Simeon, 
of Ajssva , janitor.

DCCXXXYII. 

Vellum, about 8|in, by 6, consisting of 
113 leaves, some of which are slightly staiued 
and torn, especially foil. 1 — 3, 25, 60, and 
64. The quires, the number of which is 
uncertain, were originally signed with arith- 
metical figures (fol. 38 a, ^u^ ). They must 
have fallen into confusion at an early period, 
and have been renumbered, often incorrectly, 
by at least two hands, with Syriac letters at 
the foot of the page and Coptic letters at the 
top. Leaves are now wanting at the begin-

As mentioned above, a large portion of 
this manuscript is palimpsest, the scribe 



having made use of parts of three older 
volumes. 

1. Foil. 20 and 34. Two leaves from a 
manuscript of the book of Jeremiah, accord- 
ing to the Peshitta version, written in two 
columns, in a fine Estrangela of the vi"* cent. 
Fol. 34 contains ch. xxii. 17 — ch. xxiii. 3 ; 
and fol. 20, ch. xxiiL 34 — ch. xxv. 1. 

2. Foil. 16, 27, and 38. Three leaves 
from a manuscript of the epistle of S. Paul 
to the Romans, according to the Peshitta 
version, written in two columns, in a fine 
Estrangela of the vi* or vii"' cent. Fol. 38 
contains ch. ii. 23 — ch. iii. 21 ; fol. 16, 
ch. iii. 21 — ch. iv. 15 ; and fol. 27, ch. vi. 19 
— ch. vii. 20. 

3. The remaining leaves are taken from a 
manuscript of the homilies of John Chry- 
sostom on the epistle to the Romans, 
written in double columns, in a small, 
elegant character of the vi*"" or vii* cent. The 
running title is distinctly legible in several 
places ; for example, on foil. 24 b and 25 a,

DCCLI. 

Vellum, about IO4 in. by 6|, consisting of 
23 leaves, some of which are much stained 
and torn, especially foil. 1, 4 — 6, 12 — 15, 
17 — 21, and 23. The quires are signed with 
letters, and were originally at least 22 in 
number (fol 7 a, ^; fol. 21 a, .^ia) ; but 
not a single one is now perfect. As at pre- 
sent bound, there are lacunae after foU. 4, 5, 
6, 7, 8, 10, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 18, and 22. 
Each page is divided into two columns, of 
from 34 to 38 Unes. This volume is written 
in a good, current hand of the vi"" or vii*'' 
cent. Its contents are as follow — 



1. The "Explanatio duodecim capitum" 
of Cyril of Alexandria, from the seventh 
anathema (Opera, t. vi., p. 153 A) to the 
end. Pol. 1 a. 

2. A letter written by the orthodox bishops 
(Sergius, Marion, ..^isa , Nonnus, rdjcu , 
Thomas, and John) to the monks of Amid :

directed against the heresy of Julian of 
Halicarnassus, the phantasiast, and supports 
the opinion of Severus of Antioch. 

3. The following leaves, foil. 5 — ^14, being 
nearly aU disconnected, it is difficult to say 
whether they are rightly arranged, or not. 
They not improbably belong to several trea- 
tises on the same subject. 

a. Against the Diphysites and the council 
of Chalcedon ; a small fragment. Pol. 5. 

b. Directions regarding the reception of 
those who have been in communion with 
heretics (such as the Diphysites and others). 
Pol. 6 a. 

c. The creed of Pelix, bishop of Rome:

Whether the fly-leaf, fol. 23, which is 
much stained and torn, really belongs to 
this manuscript, is doubtful. It contains, 
on the verso, two short extracts from the 
writings of Severus of Antioch. On the 
recto, there are three entries of deaths, all 
of which have been purposely effaced. The 
first is that of a bishop. In the third, the 
words rc*'i'i\.i ^Avsao are still legible, show- 
ing that these entries belong to the third 
cent, of the Hijra, A.D. 815—912. 

[Add. 14,663.] 



DCCLII. 

Vellum, about 8 in. by 5^, consisting of 
261 leaves, many of which are stained and 
defaced, and several much torn, especially 
foil. 1—8, 13, 29, 54, 160, 184, 186, 188, 
189 and 252. The quires, which are signed 
with letters, were 29 in number, but the 
first is missing, and the second and third 
are imperfect. Leaves are wanting after 
foil. 3, 5, 14 and 252. The greater part of 
the manuscript is written in a good, regular 
character, and dated A. Gr. 1127, A.D. 816 ; 
but foil. 190 — 252 are much older, being 
written in a fine large Estrangela of the vi"* 
or vii"" cent. In the former portion, the 
number of lines in each page varies from 
18 to 25 ; in the latter, from 23 to 28. The 
contents are as follow —

>1 ooco ^Jii , we read the note, [ j»cvL'i]ajj 

asaax. , I, Cyril the stranger, have written : 
his mother's name was Anthusa" {"Avdova-a). 
That the name of the annotator was really 
Cyril, appears from another note on fol. 146 a : 

"Cyril has written: this is hy Evagrius" 
(which is, however, a mistake). 

The later writing on fol. 1 a is too much 
defaced and mutilated to be intelligible.

DCCLVI. 

Vellum, about 9f in. by 6|, consisting of 
78 leaves, the last of which is much torn 
and otherwise injured. The quires, signed 
with letters, were originally 21 in number, 
but only the last eight (.-u-. — rd_A) now 
remain. Each page is divided into two 
columns, of from 32 to 39 lines. This manu- 
script is written in a fine, regular Estrangela, 
and dates from about the middle of the vii''' 
cent, (see below) ; with the exception of foil. 
71 and 72, which are two or three centuries 
later. It contains — 

1. A treatise of Theodotus, bishop of 
Ancyra, against Nestorius, written in the 
form of a dialogue between Nestorius 
(a>a__.ia_\jaaj) and one of the orthodox 
(p<'aj^o.iA>ire'), in three parts. It is divided 
into 25 chapters, of which the first discourse 
contained seven, the second has likewise 
seven, and the third eleven. The whole of 
the first discourse is wanting.

fect at the beginning. Fol. 1 a.

Vellum, about 10 in. by 6g, consisting of 
230 leaves, some of which are much stained 
(e.g. foil. 186 and 187) and not a few more 
or less torn (e.g. foil. 10, 19, 36, 56, 67, 
65—68, 126, 141, 171, 185—188, and 227 
— 230). The quires, signed with letters, are 
26 in number, but nearly the whole of ^ 
and » has been lost, and several of the others 
are imperfect. Leaves are wanting after 
foU. 26, 27, 57, 61, 64, 70, 72, 73, 184, and 



185. Each page is divided into two columns, 
containing, in the older part of the manu- 
script, from 31 to 36 lines, in the later, 
from 31 to 44. The greater part of the 
volume, from fol. 2 i to fol. 216 a (with the 
exception of foU. 214 and 215), is written in 
a small, regular EstrangSla of the vii"* cent.; 
the remainder, viz. foil. 214, 215, and 216 a 
— 230 b, in a current hand of the ix*** cent. 

I. The older portion of the manuscript, 
foil. 1 — 216, contains metrical homUies of 
Jacob of Batnae, pdxaAso jan\.i ,iiio; viz. 

1. re'Av.'ia.i rdmo^ A^.i , on the Creation 
of the Universe, or relaicu ^^.i , on the Six 
Days. See Assemani, Bibl. Or., t. i., p. 339,

that the volume was presented by certain

not much later date, on fol. 1 a, records the 
fact of its belonging to the convent. It 
must, however, have been purloined soon 
after, since we learn from a second note on 
fol. 1 a that it was restored by one Mel- 
chizedek, who had got it as a present from 
the monk Jacob of Samosata : .^ «n whw^

The colophon on fol. 146 b is so much 
stained and effaced that hardly a single line 
of it is now completely legible. It does not 
appear, however, to have contained a date, 
and the name of the scribe seems to have 
been purposely erased. 

On fol. 1 a there is an extract from some 
author in the same handwriting as the rest 
of the book ; but it is also too much stained 
and effaced to be intelligible.

This anathema does not seem to have 
troubled the abbat Moses of Nisibis, for, 
after efiacing a considerable portion of the 
above note, he has recorded there that the 
book was presented through him to the con- 
vent of S. Mary Deipara by the priest John, 
the son of George, the son of ,oJ^i-a , of 
Bagdad. The note also teUs us that the 
abbat Moses went to Bagdad to obtain the 
remission of the poll-tax (rtfjci j^«i_^) 
demanded from the monks, in the year 1238, 
A.D. 927 (compare Cureton, The Festal Let-

Vellum, about 12§ in. by 9f , consisting of 
141 leaves (Add. 12,170, foil. 136—276), 
some of which are slightly stained and 
the last much . torn. The quires appear 
to have been originally 22 in number, of 
which the first 7 are now lost, with the 
exception of two leaves. They have been 
twice re-numbered with letters, not always 
correctly. Each page is divided into two 
columns, except foil. 266 b and 267 a and b. 
Owing to differences in the size of the 
writing, the number of lines in each column 
varies from 33 or 34 to 60 or 61. The 
character is a good, clear Estrangela of the 
viii"' cent, or the beginning of the ix"^. 
The contents are as foUow.

On fol. 281 5 is a note, stating that 
this manuscript was written by the said 
Theodosius, for the Tagritan monks Mat- 
thew, Abraham and Jacob, who deposited it 
in the convent of S. Mary Deipara, at the 
time when Dionysius was patriarch of An- 
tioch, Jacob patriarch of Egypt, and Basil 
metropolitan of Tagrit. Now Dionysius of 
Tell-mahar sat A.D. 818 — 845; Jacob sat 
A.D. 819—836; and BasU of Tagrit died 
A.D. 830 (see Assemani, Bibl. Or., t. ii., 
p. 434 ) . Consequently, this manuscript 
was written between A.D. 819 and 830.

On fol. 2 a is a later note, the former 
portion of which consists of the usual 
anathemas, whilst the latter portion informs 
us that this was one of the hooks conveyed 
to the convent of S. Mary Deipara by the 
abbat Moses of Nisibis ia the year 1308 
(A.D. 997). Here there is a double mistake, 
as Moses did not set out on his journey for 
at least a hundred years after the book was 
written, expressly for the convent, and re- 
turned to Scete in 1243 (A.D. 932). Probably 
A.D. 997 was the year in which this note 
was written, and the writer inadvertently 
substituted it for A.D. 932, r^hy^h\r£sa A^oen

As mentioned above, this volume is pa- 
limpsest throughout, and the miserable 
monk Aaron deserves the execration of 
every theologian and Syriac scholar, for 
having destroyed a manuscript of the vi"' 
cent., written in three columns, con- 
taining works of Ephraim, some of which 
are as yet unedited. Fortunately a por- 
tion of it (nineteen leaves) escaped his 
ruthless hands, and now forms a part of 
Add. 14,574 (see above, no. DXXXV.). From 
the running titles, which are still distinctly 
visible in several places, it appears that the 
manuscript contained, amongst others, dis- 
courses against false doctrines, addressed to 
Hypatius (<wi\«\ocn.i , foil. 20 b, 37 a, 38 b, 
46 a) and to Domnus (oocuso.t.i , foil. 54 a, 
77 a, 78 a). The titles of some of the dis- 
courses can still be read with ease ; e.g. fol.

5^, nearly all more or less stained and torn 
(Add. 17,216, foil. 9—21), belonging to a 
neatly written, apparently Nestorian, manu- 
script of the ix*^ or x"' cent. There are from 
30 to 36 lines in each page. The contents 
are — 

1. Philosophical and theological disqui- 
sitions, partly in the form of a dialogue, the 
interlocutors being distinguished as k' {^^^, 
fol. 9 fi, line 5 ; ^t^, fol. 11 a, line 4) and co.

whether God became incarnate, fol. 9 b ; 
effaced heading, fol. 11 a ; r«lz.^ A^s , on 
the soul, fol. 13 b (see Add. 14,535, no. 8, b) ;

DCCCVI. 

VeUum, about 6| in. by 4|, consisting 
of 276 leaves, some of which are much 
stained and torn, especially foil. 1, 2, 
8, 261, and 266. The quires, signed with 



letters, were originally at least 26 in num- 
ber, but of these the first two and the last 
are lost. The remainder consist mostly of 
ten or twelve leaves ; but -^ has no less than 
27, and jjl> no less than 22. The number of 
lines in each page varies from 19 to 26. 
This volume is written in a good, regular

"the Ladder" (/cXtyoaf). See Add. 12,160, 
fol. 163 a; 14,612, no. 20; 14,621, no. 4; 
17,193, fol. 3 a; and Assemani, Bibl. Or,, 
t. i., p. 568, no xix., " liber graduum." The 
writer of the prefatory notice, fol. 1 a, states 
that the name of the author was unknown, 
but that tradition reported him to have been 
one of the younger disciples of the Apostles, 
and that he wrote in Syriac : nirj4\_A ^

Fol. 129 is Greek palimpsest. The cha- 
racters are neat, slanting uncials of about 
the viii"' cent., and the capital letters were 
ornamented with green paint. 

[Add. 14,613.] 



DCCCVII. 

Vellum, about 7| in. by 5|, consisting of 
9 leaves (Add. 14,631, foil. 46 — 53), of 
which the first and last are much stained 
and torn. There are from 29 to 39 lines in 
each page. The writing is good and regular, 
partly Estrangela, partly current, of the ix* 
or x'*' cent. The contents are — 

1. Part of a prayer. Pol. 45 a. 

2. Questions addressed by the priest Ser- 
gius to John bar Cyriacus, bishop of Telia, 
with the replies of the latter. These are 
also called the Canons of John of TeUa.

Fol. 53 b was also covered with writing 
by the same hand, but this leaf is so much 



mutilated, that it is impossible to say what 
the subject was. 

Fol. 45 is palimpsest. The more ancient 
text is Coptic, written in double colimms, 
in uncial characters of about the vii"' cent. 
Perhaps the leaf belonged to the palimpsest 
that appears in Add. 17,183.

As mentioned above, this volume is 
palimpsest throughout. The more ancient 
text is that of a Coptic manuscript, written 
in uncial characters, of about the vii*'' cent; 
Each page is divided into two columns of 25 
lines. The initial letters of verses are larger 
than the rest, and there are numerous 
ornamental figures, principally of birds. 
This once handsome volume contained 
several books of the Old Testament in the 
Sahidic dialect. Thus, on fol. 42 J, which 
has been left partially blank by the later 
scribe, we find Esther, ch. iv. 3 — 8 ; on fol. 
60 a, part of Judges, ch. i. 13, 15 ; on fol. 
108 a, which has been left wholly blank by 
the later scribe. Judges, ch. ix. 31 — 36 ; on 
fol. 116 a and h, part of Judges, ch. ix. 18, 
20, 23, 25; on fol. 163 a and h, part of 
Ruth, ch. iii. 14, 16, and ch. iv. 1 ; and on 
fol. 164 J, part of Euth, ch. iv. 13, 16.

Vellum, about llf in. by 71, consisting of 
96 leaves, a few of which are much stained 
and soiled, especially foil. 1, 2, 34, and 96. 
The quires, signed with letters, were origi-

DCCCXVIII. 

Vellum, about lOf in. by 71, consisting of 
23 leaves, most of which are more or less 
stained and torn. Eoll. 1, 18, 21, and 22, 
are mutilated, one half of each being lost. 

These leaves are all that remain of 
a Greek Evangelistarium, belonging ap- 
parently to the vii* or viii**" cent. It is 
written in uncial characters, of the Egyptian 
type, with large initial letters. Of the 
rubrics some traces are still visible, e.g. foil. 
1 b,7 b, 11 a, 12 a, and 19 a and b. A few of 
the initials have also been coloured red, e.g. 
foil. 15 b and 17 b. The text is most dis- 
tinctly legible on the upper half of foil. 19 
and 20, which served as fly-leaves to the 
manuscript in its later form. 

About the end of the x* cent., these 
leaves were destroyed by a Syrian monk. 



who folded them so as to form a volume, at 
present consisting of 42 leaves, or five quires, 
signed partly with letters and partly with 
arithmetical figures, of which the first is now 
incomplete. The contents are — 

1. An ascetic discourse, imperfect both at 
the beginning and end. Fol. 1 a. 

2. Extracts from the Lives of the Egyptian 
Fathers ; imperfect at the beginning. Fol. 
6 a. On fol. 10 a there is the rubric A-^:i

DCCCXIX. 

Vellum, about 9| in. by 6^, consisting of 
178 leaves (Add. 12,163, foil. 127—304), or 
18 quires, signed with letters. In reality, 
however, it is made up of two distinct manu- 
scripts, the one comprising foil. 127 — 224, the 
other foil. 225—304. The former seems to 
have been transcribed by at least two per- 
sons (foil. 128 6—197 and foil. 198—224). 
Both are written in current hands of the 
X* or xi*^ cent. The contents are — 

1. Discourse of John Chrysostom on vir- 
ginity and repentance, ,xsa r<lx>.-ixi.i r^xxrCsa

DCCCXXI. 

Eleven vellum leaves, all more or less 
stained and torn, but apparently belonging 
to the same Coptic manuscript (Add. 14,665, 
foU. 10—20). EoU. 17—19 are the best pre- 
served, and measure about 11 in. by 8|. The 
text is written in two columns, of from 33 
to 39 lines, in a fine, regular character, pro- 
bably of the vi"" or vii* cent. The dialect 



is the Sahidio or that of Upper Egypt 

(jj^il). 

Eol. 19 contains Genesis, ch. xxiv. 52 — ch. 
XXV. 6 ; fol. 17, Numbers, ch. xviii. 17 — ch. 
xix. 4 ; and fol. 18, Ntmibers, ch. xxii. 18 — 
36. Eoll. 10 — 16 are so mutilated, and the 
ancient writing is so much obKterated, that 
it is difficult to say, without employing 
chemical reagents, what portions of Scripture 
they comprise. Eol. 20 is made up of eight 
discpnnected fragments, merely put together 
in order to preserve them. 

These leaves were folded so as to form a 
volimie measuring about 8| in. by 5^, the 
Syriac text of which is written in a good, 
regular hand of the x**" or xi* cent. The 
contents are — 

1. The martyrdom of Peter of Alexandria : 
t^!a>Qnt« I g^K* '. J30o't\& K^x^.To.i r^^o.icnxio 

Eoll. 18, upper half, a and J, 10 b and a.

Antichrist, r^^i-w [JL^m .scua-v^ tisa:i]

foil. 11 and 12 are also from a discourse of 
Jacob of Batnae.

Vellum, about 16^ in. by llf , consisting 
of 356 leaves, some of which are much 
stained and torn (e.g. foU. 11, 15, 346, 347

Vellum, about 6| in. by 4|, consisting of 
53 leaves, many of wbich are much stained 
and torn, especially foU. 1—6, 25—30, 37, 
and 50 — 53. The quires, signed with letters, 
were at least twelve in number (^ , fol. 
31 a) ; but the volume is imperfect both at 
the beginning and end, and leaves are 
wanting after foU. 1, 3, 5, 6, 24, 25, 27, 28, 
30, 37, and 49. There are from 16 to 21 
lines in each page. The writing (apparently 
by two persons) is rather inelegant, and 
seems to be of the xi"' or xii"" cent. The 
contents are —

DCCCXXX. 

Vellum, about 5| in. by 4^, consisting of 
74 leaves. The quires, signed with letters, 
were probably nine in number, of which the 
first and last are wanting. Each page has 
from 19 to 25 Knes. This volume, which is 
palimpsest throughout (see below), is written 
in a current hand of the xi"^ or xii* cent., 
with a few Greek vowels (see, for instance, 
foil. 11 b and 14 b). The contents are — 

1. Discourses of John Chrysostom ; viz. — 

a. On the Presentation of our Lord in the 
Temple and on S. Simeon the Aged ; imper- 
fect at the beginning. Eol. 1 a.

As mentioned above, this volume is pa- 
limpsest throughout, and seems to contain 
portions of four manuscripts. 

1. Fragments of a Lectionary from the 
Gospels, apparently of the ix* cent. Foil. 
66 — 71. On fol. 69 a we find the rubric, 

..oAl^or^ . .aoi^.i r^lsaOdi cn^^.i r^j.*ia 

,xa*o->.i . .T_o ; and again on fol. 71 a the 
heading rddcd . 

2. Fragments of a similar volume, of some- 
what later date, perhaps belongiag to the 



same manuscript as Add. 14,451, fol. 88, and 
Add. 14,452, fol. 58. For example, on fol. 
3 6 we find S. Matthew, ch. xx. 32 ; on fol. 
5 b, S. John, ch. xv. 1 ; on fol. 6 a, S. John, 
ch. XV. 5 ; on fol. 8 h, S. Matthew, ch. iii. 15; 
on fol. 16 a, S. Luke, ch. xxiii. 19 ; on fol. 
15 h, S. Luke, ch. xxiii. 29 ; on foil. 30 b and 
31 a, S. Matthew, ch. xxviii. 12 ; etc. 

3. A few leaves from a manuscript 
of the vii"' or viii"" cent., of which the 
contents cannot be stated with certainty. 
Fol. 35 b seems to contain the commence- 
ment of a letter : kC^qsoooco^si.-io qoocdi^^.i

in with this ". 

4. Two leaves, foil. 2 and 9, from a manu- 
script of the Oct6echos of Severus, of about 
the ix"* cent. On fol. 2 5 we can distinctly 

discern the numbers co«i , oooi ^ and »»i ,

DCCCXXXI. 

Vellum, about 5f in. by 3|, consisting of 
88 leaves, many of which are much stained 
and soiled, and a few of them torn, especially 
foil. 1, 87, and 88. The quires have no sig- 
natures, and the first is imperfect, a leaf 
being wanting at the beginning. The num- 
ber of lines in each page varies from 10 to 
20. This manuscript, which is palimpsest 
throughout (see below), is written, perhaps 
by two hands, in an inelegant character of 
the xi'^ or xii*^ cent., and contains — 

1. An exposition of Ps. vi. by John Chry- 
sostom, imperfect at the beginning. Fol. 1 a.

There are from 18 to 25 lines in each page. 
This manuscript is written in a small, cur- 
rent hand, and dated A. Gr. 1483-4, A.D.

A.D, 1404, by the name of Basil; and to 
that of patriarch, in 1723, A.D, 1412, by the

read, in a more recent hand, the date, /\XX

(A.D. 1185), which is evidently wrong.

On fol. 255 6 is a note stating that this 
was one of the volumes brought to the con- 
vent of S. Mary Deipara by the abbat Moses 
of Nisibis, A. Gr. 1243, A.D. 932.

DCCCLIII. 

Vellum, about 14<| in. by 12|, consisting 
of 233 leaves, a few of which, at the begin- 
ning and end, are much stained and slightly 
torn. The volume originally consisted of 
35 quires*, signed with letters ; but the first 
12 have been lost, with the exception of two 
leaves of »<* and one leaf of ja . Each page is 
divided into two columns (only fol. 1 b has 
three), of from 36 to 49 lines. The writing 
is an inelegant Estrangela, with occasional 
Greek vowels. It was written in Egypt, 
A. Gr. 1392, A.D. 1081, and contains— 

A Catena Patrum, or Selections from the 
Writings of the Eathers, so arranged as to 
form a continuous commentary on the greater 
part of the Scriptures of the Old and New 
Testaments. This compilation was made by 
a monk of Edessa, named Severus, A. Gr. 
1172, A.D. 861.t -The books of Scripture 
are taken in the following order. 
, Genesis, fol. 1 ; Kings, fol. 4 ; the Twelve 
minor Prophets, fol. 14 a ; Ezekiel, fol. 38 b ; 



* Not 36, as erroneously given in the manuscript, for 
sheet 34 is signed ."U on the first leaf and col on the 
last. 

t Another manuscript of the same work is described 
by Assemani in the Bibl. Or., t. i., pp. 63 and 607 ; but 
he is certainly mistaken in speaking of it as " esaratus a 
Severo," the scribe being doubtless Simeon of Hisn Man- 
sur. Copious extracts from this work are given in the 
Eoman edition of Ephraim Syrus, t. i., pp. 116 seqq. 
t. ii., pp. 1 — 315. 



Jeremiah and Lamentations, fol. 47 a ; the 
Song of Songs, fol. 55 b ; Daniel and Susanna, 
fol. 60 b ; Isaiah, fol. 68 b, with a supplement 
commencing on fol. 96 b ; Proverbs and 
Ecclesiastes, fol. 116 a*

pel according to S. Matthew, fol. 176 a; 
according to S. John, fol. 208 b. 

Ephraim Syrus is the chief authority on 
Kings, the Twelve minor Prophets, Ezekiel, 
Jeremiah and Lamentations, Daniel, and 
Isaiah. In the remaining fragments of the 
commentary on Genesis he is cited by name 

on fol. 3 a, . "p^r^ . iv-oa r^ r<x:si . .\\-3M 

as also once in the commentary on the Pro- 
verbs (ch. XXX. 15), fol. 117 a ; and once in 

that on S. Matthew (ch. xxiii. 34), ^ so 

rC'.vV-.' A\-t3 . ■\ 'b.t r<'i2>3r<lSJa , fol. 202 b. 

On the New Testament the principal 
authority is John Chrysostom. He is also 
cited in the commentary on Genesis (ch. iii. 
14, 15), fol. 3 a, and in that on Daniel 
(ch. xii. 11 — 13), T^.tcLi A.^.i am ^

the Song of Songs, foil. 55 b, seqq., 59 b, 
seqq. ; and on S, Matthew, eh. xvii. 27, fol. 
198 a. The commentary on Genesis, foU. 1 
and 2, seems to be taken chiefly from Jacob 
of Edessa. 

At the end of the commentary on the Old 
Testament, fol. 123 b, is the following colo- 
phon : rt^n T.QA •• »,_j^.l coji.iCLSkja . >5lx- 
r<Ha>oo . ry*T*TiMai . ^.i cucn : r<'iui^<^\^ ooj^.t 

On fol. 233 b (which is slightly torn) is a 
similar colophon : : ..j^.i : cnii.iasi.a . >\t.

pious Metropolitan Constantine. He (Seve- 
rus) spent the time, during which he was 
engaged in this work, without books; but 
he laboured hard, and performed aU this 
work, and coUected these elucidations from 
the Old and New Testaments, for the com- 
fort of himself and of aU who may fall in 
(with them). And I implore every one who 
takes it and derives profit from it, or wishes 
to copy it, to fulfil the written word that 
says : ' Pray for one another, that ye may be 
healed' (S. James, v. 16). And for the love 
of Christ, let him transcribe this record, and 
pray for the aforesaid sinner, that the Lord 
may heal all the sin-sores that are upon his 
soul and body, through the prayers of the 
Prophets who have prophesied, etc. We 
have nvimbered the exposition of the Old 
Testament (as given in this book) ; of Mar 
Ephraim 5600 (scholia) ; and of Mar Jacob 
of Edessa on the whole Torah, and Job 
and Joshua, with a few illustrations scat- 
tered through the book, 2860 (scholia). And 
we have numbered the exposition of the 
Gospels of S. Matthew and S. John, which 
is chiefly by Mar John (Chrysostom), with 
some extracts from other (commentators, 
and it consists of) 2400 (scholia). The 
whole, then, as numbered, amounts to 
10,860 (schoUa)."

" This book of life and profit belongs to 
the humble Samuel, who is in name a monk 
or sty lite; who laboured, and worked, and 
wrote, according to his strength and the 
smallness of his knowledge. Just as a man 
places before him a beautiful picture, and 
wishes to copy it in the absence of the 
artist, and (as I think is known to every 
one) takes great pains, and works hard, 
and is lavish of his pigments, and so, by 
the gift of the merciful God, the work is 
brought to its completion ; in the same way 
I too, a feeble man, have been toiling hard 
for more than three years at the perfecting 
of this book of spiritual expositions. It was

finished by the hands of the aforesaid sinner, 
in the monastery of the Mother of God, 
which is in Gazarta, in the region of Alex- 
andria the Great, through the care of the 
blessed and just elders, who are like unto 
Abraham, Mar Mauhub and Mar Fahd, and 
their beloved sons John and Mansur, heirs 
of the kingdom of heaven and children of 
the bridechamber of light. Amen. This 
book was finished on the 25*'' of the month 
of Adar, in the year of the Greeks 1392 
(A.D. 1081), on the day of the Aimuncia- 
tion of the Mother of God and perpetual 
Virgin, the blessed Mary. But I beseech 
every one who takes it and profits by it, 
or wishes to copy it, to correct it accord- 
ing to his ability, and not to find fault, 
because every creature is feeble; as it is 
written (above) that, for the love of Christ, 
he should fulfil the written word that says, 
' Pray for one another, that ye may be 
healed.' Pray for the aforesaid sinner and 
for his parents in this life "

Vellum, about S^ in. by 5^, consisting of 
58 leaves, many of which are much stained 
and torn, especiaUy foil. 7, 11—18, 20, 21, 
27 — 29, and 36. Leaves are wanting at the 
beginning, as well as after foil. 4, 8, 10, 18, 
34, 35, 36, 40, 48, 49, and 50. There are 
from 20 to 32 lines in each page. This 
volume, which is palimpsest throughout, is 
written in an inelegant, current hand of 
the latter half of the x*'' cent. It con- 
taias — 

1. Demonstrations from the Scriptures of 
the Old and New Testaments, as well as 
from the Apocrypha, on various points of 
religion, morals, and Christian duty; e.g.

fol. 26 a, (<lsa&.i rC^.ss'iK'o ^^i\.i relr.*! 

^ii vAvjsq ms3^ ; and so on. The Septuagint 
version is often cited (^. v* i) ; e.g. foil. 1 a, 
17 a and b, 18 a and b, 19 b, 20 b, 21 a, 28 a, 
27 a, 28 a, 31 b, and 38 a. 

2. Prayers and discourses for several occa- 
sions, fol. 41 a; e.g. reCaiusoiix.i , for a bishop 
on his installation, fol. 43 a, and r<'^ca:^ick& 
r^ocp cni~yi.i , fol. 44 a; r^flcui<i^ci» JL^.i , 
for the accompanying clergy, fol. 45 a, and

ni^:! r^AOinftii°>r<'.i r<l&a.a^ A^..i , funeral 
sermon for a deceased bishop, fol. 50 b ; etc. 

Fol. 40 b contains part of a prayer in 
Greek, written in large slanting uncials by 
the same hand as the Syriac text. Poll. 57 
and 58 also contain Greek texts in the same 
handwriting; viz. a prayer for the patri- 
archs of the Jacobite church of Alexandria 
(to whose names is annexed that of Severus 
of Antioch), fol. 57 b and a; and a list of 
contractions, "Re : KC : KN : KY : KW: 
etc., foil. 57 a and 58 a. The last Alexan- 
drine patriarch mentioned in the prayer is 
Menas II., who sat from about A.D. 958 to 
977; whence it seems to follow that this 
manuscript was written during his lifetime 
or that of his immediate successor. Pol. 58 b 
contains an extract in Syriac from the Acts of 
the Council of Ephesus regarding Nestorius. 

As mentioned above, this volume is pa- 
limpsest throughout, and contains portions 
of the Old and New Testaments, according 
to the Peshitta version, written in two 
columns, in a fine hand of the vi* or 
vii*" century. The ancient text is most 
distinctly legible on foil. 49 b, 50 a, and 



catena; patrum, etc.

102, and 107. Each page is divided into 
two columns, of from 32 to 39 lines. This 
manuscript is written in a neat Estrangela 
of the vii"* cent., and contains —

various Biblical passages and subjects.

the original number of chapters was, it is 
now impossible to say. The index, fol. 1 a, 
which is imperfect, has only 96 (o-) ; but 
the last number occurring in the book, fol. 
102 6, is 129 (Ji^) . The chapters actually 



extant are: xvii. — liii. (impf.), Iv. (impf.)

DCCCLVII. 

Vellum, about 11^ in. by 7§, consisting of 
268 leaves, some of which, especially near 
the beginning and end, are much stained 
and torn. The quires, 27 in number, are 
signed with letters. With the exception 
of foil. 1 and 267, each page is divided 
into two columns, of from 43 to 61 lines. 
This manuscript is written in a small, neat 
hand, apparently of the viii*^ cent, (see 
below). The writing on foil. 1 and 267 
is of somewhat later date, and the same 
hand has added a few of the marginal notes. 

The title of the manuscript, fol. 2 S, is : 

[re'i\kSL]4JLX-S9 .xoiJsoicD A-intxl.i , " a volume 
of Demonstrations from the holy Pathers

nliM^o ^lygiAto can now be deciphered. It 
may not improbably have been A. Gr. 1058, 
A.D. 747. Another note on fol. 268 a has 
also been intentionally erased. 

Eol. 1 contains extracts from Basil, ^

to the Romans, and on Titus, hom. i. ; and 
Cyril, r^hy^n ifn.i r^=3^ po . A note on 
fol. 1 b, apparently in a different hand, has 
been purposely erased. 

Eol. 267 contains a section, in the same

Gregory Nazianzen is cited several times. 
At the end we read that these two leaves 



were written by one Severus: f^ioptLw 

[Add. 12,155.] 



DCCCLVIII. 

Vellum, about 9f in. by 6|, consisting of 
221 leaves, of which two (foil. 24 and 26) 
are much stained and torn. The quires, 
signed with letters, were originally at least 
24 in number (fol. 208 a, Ai^), but several 
are now either imperfect or altogether lost. 
Leaves are wanting after foil. 9, 23, 25, 118, 
217, and 221. Each page is divided into two 
columns, of from 32 to 44 lines. This ma- 
nuscript is written in an elegant Estrangela, 
and seems to be of the viu"" cent. 

The title is : r^i&icnsK'.-i re'iucLu^.i «'duAi& 

rc'A\«\* »T*n oo^ooicD A.nscA.1 . rtfx*lia , " a 

volume of Demonstrations from the holy 
Fathers against various Heresies." It is a 
monophysite compilation, and the contents 
are very various. They are in part identical 
with those of Add. 12,156, Add. 14,533, and 
Add. 14,538. There appear to be four 
principal sections, comprising in all 334 
shorter ones.* 

1. Regarding the Union of the Two 
Natures in Christ, and kindred topics, fol. 
1 b, beginning with a section entitled 

rtlMLULM ^Qaxs3:i . See Add. 14,633, fol. 
19 b. The authorities cited are — 



* The last four leaves, foil. 218 — 221, contain part of 
an Index of the contents of the volume, from § .J^ to 
§ OT . They were discovered in a MS. belonging to the 
Honourable R. Curzon, and presented by him to the 
Trustees of the British Museum in 1867.

The author commences by assigning the 
false statements and abusive language of the 
opponents of his way of thinking, as his 
principal reason for writing this defense of 

the faith : rt^^i-^cxn^^o rdnoHoo : ^^.i (^va

into a full statement of the monophysite 
doctrines (fol. 2 b), for which he claims 
the support (fol. 6 b) of Ignatius, Julius, 
Athanasius, Basil, the three Gregories, 
Theophilus, Chrysostom, Epiphanius, Cyril, 
Dioscorus, Timotheus, Severus of Antioch, 
Philoxenus of Mabug, Theodosius of Alex- 
andria, and Anthimus of Constantinople ; 
and concludes by bringing forward a consi- 
derable number of testimonies from these 
and other writers, which he has arranged in 
three chapters , fol. 7 b.

On fol. 1 a there is a coloured figure,

read the words : . rtfjco rOoiJ^ ^.i i-.

Vellum, about 9f in. by 7, consisting of 
92 leaves, a few of which are nauch stained 
and torn, especially foil. 1, 2, 10, 82, and 
84. The quires, signed with letters, are 9 
in number, A leaf is wanting after fol. 82, 



and nearly the whole of fol. 1 has been torn 
away. There are from 26 to 33 lines in 
each page. This volume, which is palimp- 
sest throughout, is written in a rather in- 
elegant Estrangela, and dated A. Gr. 1399, 
A.D. 1088. It contains— 

A Commentary on the Revelation of 
S. John, divided into 72 chapters. Chapter 1 
is wanting, and chapters 2, 52, and 53, are 
imperfect. 

The text of each chapter is quoted in full, 
and agrees closely with that of Lee's edition. 
The commentary, notwithstanding the coin- 
cidence in the number of chapters, has but 
little in common with that of Andrew and 
Arethas, as edited, for example, in the 
Parisian edition of (Ecumenius (1630 — 31, t. 
ii., pp. 640, seqq.), or in Cramer's Catena in 
Epistolas CathoHcas etc., Oxon. 1840, pp. 177, 
seqq. Chapter 3 may serve as a specimen.

into Aramaic, ia the city of Mabug, in the 
year 812, A.D. 501. This manuscript was 
not improbably written in the same year.

Another note on the same page, written in 
a small, cursive hand of the vii* cent., but 
of which considerable portions have been 
erased, informs us that the book was pre- 
sented by the priest Mar , abbat of 

Beth-Raman (?), to a certain convent, in the 
cemetery of which he was afterwards buried.

Beneath this there is one of the usual 
forms of anathema, written, perhaps, by a 
different hand. 

The same person who wrote one or both 
of the above notes, has utilised the fly-leaves 
at the beginning of the volume by transcrib- 
ing on them — 

Questions addressed to Timothy of Alex- 
andria, with his replies : anvo^K'.i r^nstojc.

fol. 29 6, and 14,527, fol. 23 b. 

Of the erased note at the end of these Ques- 
tions, on the mutilated fol. 3 a, nothing can 

be read with certainty but the name ^di". 

A monk named Abraham has recorded on 

fol. 9 a that he met with this book in the

It was he, in all probability, who perpe- 
trated the erasures on foil. 9 and 10 ; but 
the alterations on foil. 86 a, 119 «, 136 6, 
138 a, and 144 b, seem to be the work of 
other hands.

VeUum, about 9| in. by 6, consisting of 
39 leaves, the last of which is soiled and 
torn. The quires, four in number, are 
signed with letters, from cn%. to ma., but 
there was an older numeration, apparently 
from OA to ^^ (see fol. 31 a). Each page is 
divided into two columns, of from 33 to 43 
Hues. This manuscript is written in a small, 
neat hand of the vii*'' cent., probably soon 
after A.D. 641 (see below, no. 18). It 
contains —

unfortunately, the most important part has

Each page is divided into two columns, of

fine, regular Estrangela of the viii"' cent. 
The contents are identical with a portion of 
those of the preceding number. They are — 

1. A Synopsis of the Canons of the Apostles 
and the principal Councils, arranged under 
51 heads. Eol. 40 b. The prefatory section 
is omitted. 

2. The Canons of the Apostles, as far as

DCCCCXI. 

Vellum, about Qf in. by 6f , consisting of 
130 leaves, a few of which are stained and 
torn, especially foil. 1—3, 13, and 130. The 
quires, signed with both letters and arith- 
metical figures (e. g. fol. 64 a, ^^) are 14 

in number ; but the first is imperfect, leaves 
being wanting at the beginning, as well as 
after foil. 1 and 2. Each page is divided 
into two columns, of from 26 to 36 lines. 
This volume is written in a fine, regular 
Estrangela of the vi'** cent., and contains — 

The first five books of the Ecclesiastical 
History of Eusebius of Csesarea.* The title, 
as given in the heading and subscription of 
each book, is r<'i\.%-Jk.."! k'A\„« s t.Ai ; but the

probability to the middle of the viii*'' cent. 
The contents are — 

1. Geographical notes, imperfect both at 
the beginning and end. Fol. 1 a. These 
have been published by Land in his Anec- 
dota Syriaca, t. i., pp. 23 — 24 of the text. 

2. A Chronicle, or rather a collection of 
historical notes, the first part of which, fol. 
2 a, is chiefly derived from the Chronicle of 
Eusebius; whilst the second part, fol. 35 b, 
seems to be a compilation from several later 
authorities. Erom the former, which is 
slightly imperfect at the beginning, Pro- 
fessor Rcediger has edited considerable ex- 
tracts in his Chrestomathia Syriaca, 2"'^ ed., 
p. 105 ; and he has also given a Latin trans- 
lation in Schoene's edition of the Chronicle, 
vol. ii., p. 201. The latter has been pub- 
lished by Land in his Anecd. Syr., t. i., 
pp. 2 — 22 of the text. The latest date men- 
tioned in these notes is A. Gr. 947, A.D. 636 
(fol. 50 b ; compare Land, Anecd. Syr., t. i., 
p. 168). 

3. A list of the Arab Caliphs, from the 
time of the prophet Muhammad down to 
that of Yazid II., ,coa i w.i reLj.icoa—^ 
rAxAri'.i [r<daQj]i ■\'nw.'gia . Eol. 56 b. This 
list appears to have been drawn up during 
the caliphate of Hisham, A.D. 724 — 742, not 
improbably by the transcriber of the manu- 
script himself. It has been published by 
Land, Anecd. Syr., t. i., p. 40. 

Foil. 57 b — 60 a contain short hymns, 
rdixit^ rtfAii, apparently added by a later 
hand. 

The note on fol. 60 b, in the handwriting 
of the scribe, once contained the name of 
the original possessor ; but a later owner 
erased it, and substituted his own (John), 
which has in its turn been almost completely 
effaced : ^J-mO-^.i] rdicn r<L=»A\.^ ,enaA\_.r^

A vellum leaf, 8f in. by 5|, much stained 
and torn. The writing is a good, regular 
Estrangela of the viu"" or ix* cent. This 
is the first leaf of a manuscript similar to 
Add. 14,643, and contains the commence- 
ment of an Epitome of the Chronicle of 
Eusebius, from the creation of the world 
down to A. Gr. 8—2. Title : rei_3 ....

[Add. 17,216, fol. 1.] 

DCCCCXY. 

Thirteen vellum leaves, about 11 in. by 8, 
several of which are much stained and torn, 
and two are mere fragments. The writing 
is a good, regular Estrangela, in double 
columns, of from 32 to 41 lines, of the viii* 
or ix"* cent. They contain — 

Portions of a Chronicle, based on that of 
Eusebius, with a continuation by the com- 
piler. The part extant commences with an 
account of the composition of the Septua- 
gint Version of the Scriptures, and extends, 
in a fragmentary condition, down to A. Gr. 
975 (eoj^A^At), A.D. 664.* 

[Add. 17,216, foD. 2—14.] 

* The fly-leaf fol. 1 of the St. Petersburg manuscript 

•^ of the Ecclesiastical History of Eusebius originally be- 

* longed to this manuscript. It comprises the reigns of 

Ptolemy Lagus and Ptolemy Philadelphus, some account 

of the family of the Herods, and part of the history of our 

Lord. 



DCCCCXVI. 

Vellum, about 9| in. by 6, consisting of 
41 leaves, many of which are much stained 
and torn, especially foil. 1—8, 12, 22, 24, 25, 
31, 32, and 34 — 41. The quires, signed with 
letters, seem to have been 6 in number, but 
only -\^is perfect, leaves being wanting at 
the beginning, and after foil. 7, 13, 23, and 
31. There are from 30 to 34 lines in each 
page. This volume is written in a good, 
regular hand of the earlier part of the x"* 
cent., with the exception of foil. 36 b — 39 a, 
which are in a smaller and more cursive cha- 
racter of about the same date. It contains — 

Part of a Chronicle, chiefly ecclesiastical, 
compiled from the similar works of Eusebius, 
fol. 1 6, Andronicus, foil. 1 b, 15 a, and others, 
and continued to A. Gr. 1108, A.D. 797, fol. 
36 a. The later additions, foil. 36 b—39 a, 
bring the history down to A.Gr. 1122, A.D. 
811.t 

This volume is palimpsest throughout, 
being made up, to all appearance, of por- 
tions of five Greek manuscripts. 

a. Poll. 17, 20, 24, 25, 27—29, 31, 32, and 
34 — 40, seem to belong to a Catena Patrum, 
written in slanting uncials of the earlier half 
of the ix*'' cent. The character of the rubrics 
is larger and more upright. On fol. 17 b we 
find the commencement of an extract from 
Chrysostom on a passage of the Gospel of 
S. Luke.

On fol. 29 a there are the remains of 
another heading, but the name of the Father 
who is quoted has been effaced. 

b. Several leaves from a codex of perhaps 
the vui"" cent., written in a smaller and 
more upright character (see, for example.

very faint. 

c. FoU. 1, 4, 9, 12, and perhaps a few 
others, belonged to a volume written in 
small, slanting uncials, of the viii* or ix**" 
cent. Part of a heading, in larger characters, 
is stiU visible on fol. 12 b. 

d. Fol. 11 was taken from a manuscript 
in slanting uncials, probably of the ix"" cent.; 
and 

e. Fol. 21, from one written in a smaller 
character, of the same date. 

[Add. 14,642.] 



DCCCCXYII. 

Vellum, about 7| in. by 5|, consisting of 
17 leaves, the first and last of which are 
slightly stained and torn. The writing on 
the lower half of fol. 14 6 has been inten- 
tionally erased. The quires are without 
signatures. There are from 22 to 28 lines 
in each page. This manuscript is written 
in a fine, regular Estrangela of the vi'*" cent., 
and contains — 

1. A tract, ascribed to Eusebius of Csesarea, 
showing how and whereby the Magi recog- 
nized the Star, and that Joseph did not take

VeUum, about llf in. by 9, consisting of 
171 leaves, some of which are much stained 
and torn, especially foU. 1, 9, 39, 99, 109, 
111—114, 116, and 171. The quires, signed 
with letters, were 20 in number, but the first 
is lost, and A< is imperfect, leaves being 
missing after foil. 110 and 114. Each page 
is divided into two columns, of from 30 to 
38 lines in the older portions of the volume, 
and from 26 to 36 in the more recent. The 
greater part of this manuscript, from the 
beginning to fol. 131, is written in a fine, 
regular Estrangela of the vi"" cent., with the 
exception of foil. 1—8, 19, 28, 29, 38, 59, 
68, 89, 90, 97, 98, 100, 107, 125, 126, and

the X* or xi"' cent. The later scribe has

DCCCCXIX. 

Vellum, about 10| in. by 6|, consisting of 
193 leaves, a few of which are much stained 
and torn, especiaUy foU. 8, 9, and 181. The 
quires, probably once 24 in number, were 
originally signed with arithmetical figures 
(see foil. 36 a and 154 a, where A^ and 
^^ are still faintly visible), but subse- 
quently with letters. Leaves are now want- 
ing after foil. 9 (one), 16 (two), 181, 185, 
and 193. Each page is divided into two 
columns, of from 30 to 36 Hues. This manu- 
script is written in a fine, regular Estrangela 
of the end of the vi*"* or the beginning of the 
vii'^*' cent., and contains — 

The Ecclesiastical History of Zacharias 
Rhetor, bishop of Mitylene, in twelve books, 
which has been edited by Dr. Land, and 
forms the third volume of his Anecdota 
Syriaca, Leiden, 1870. See also Assemani, 
Bibl. Or., t. ii., pp. 54, seqq. ; Mai, Scriptorum 
Vett. Nova CoUectio, t. x., pars 1, p. xi., and 
pp. 332, seqq. ; Land, Anecdota Syriaca, t. i., 
p. 38; and Noldeke in the " Literarisches 
Centralblatt" for 1871, Nr. 1. The work is 
divided in this manuscript into two volumes, 
foil. 1—107 and foil. 108—193, the first 
volume comprising five books, and the second 
seven. 

I. The actual title prefixed to the first 

book is, fol. 1 b, r^H^OOo.i rC'iAu^JL^.i rC'ikxal^ 
»<:sa\jfc.3 cuL.i^^s , " a volume of narratives of 
events which have happened in the world ;" 



but the running title 
r^i^t.i (r<La5^ou«Aiirc) , " the Ecclesiastical 
(History) of Zacharias," appears at intervals, 
e. g. foU. 3 6, 43 b, 71 b, 76 b, etc. It is 
evident, however, from the introduction to 
the third book, that the greater part of the 
first and second books has been compiled 
from different sources by a writer who lived 
only a little later than Zacharias (during the 
latter half of the vi'^ cent.), and incorporated 
in his work nearly the whole of his pre- 
decessor's labours. See Land's preface, p. x. 

The first book comprises a preface and 
eight chapters, which are indexed on fol. 
1 h (Land, p. 2). 

1. The preface, rdj-sa.Tn reix-i . Pol. 1 b. 
Erom this is extracted the following passage, 
explanatory of the contents of the first part, 
whence it appears that the history was 
brought down by the compiler to the year 
of the Greeks 880, A.D. 569 (fol. 3 a, 2""^ col., 
at the top; Land, p. 5) : ivsard^ Ajji^on rclsa^

HISTORY. 



The introduction was, therefore, divided 
into four sections. 

Section I. treated of the Canon of Eusebius 
and the error of three years in his calcula- 
tion. It commences on fol. 2 a with the 

rubric, : .£»fluaj3»or^ •'v?^-'< ^^ r^oos A\*w 

Section II. treated of the Dynasties which 
were contemporary with the Roman Empire, 
but were omitted by Eusebius. It begins on 
fol. 7 a with the rubric : pCAxaaAib ^A-rt*."! 
cflL.l cnsolax. yi\j» ocb rdiava r^ocn ouK*

^AiK'o . Aurc^i^-WTrq rejoins cna jaaQt-iOffOK' 
* . r^Ola oqp ^I'l^rC* .t& 

Section III. explained what Dynasties were 
co-ordinated by Jacob with the Roman Em- 
pire. The small fragment fol. 9 seems to 
belong to this section. 

Section IV. contained separate Chronolo- 
gies of each of these Dynasties. 

Then followed the Chronological Canon, 
commencing, on fol. 10 a, with Olympiad 
CCLXXVI., aa^'i jor<i&sne\<ST^ , and ending 
in this mutilated manuscript with Olympiad 
CCCLII., r^iT, jwrd.-^jsaolorc'. The last 
monarchs mentioned are Heraclius I. of Con- 
stantinople, .nxx.A.are'icD ; Ardeshir III. of 
Persia, >oi&x..i coi=» iktair^; and Abu Bakr, 
^^r<saecaT<, the successor of Muhammad.

Some portions of this work have been 
edited by pupils of the late Professor Tull- 
berg of Upsala, under the title of "libri 
qui insoribitur Paradisus Patrum partes 
selectae," Upsala, 1851 ; viz. — 

1. John of Lycos. See fol. 118 6. 

2. Ephraim, deacon of Edessa. See fol. 
124 i. 

3. Chronius of Phoenicia. See fol. 121 b. 

4. Jacob the lame (r^i ■ \^w) . See fol. 
121 J. 

5. Paul, the disciple of Antony, and 

6. Pachomius; both apparently wanting 
in this manuscript. 

7. On holy women. See fol. 126 b. 

8. The virgin ,_oi^i-w\ (or Taor). See 
fol. 127 b. 

9. The virgin Colluthus (KoWow^os). See 
fol. 127 b. 

10. A virgin who feU and repented. See 
fol. 136 a. 

11. Abba Elias. See fol. 136 a. 

Prom the above, and from the table of con- 
tents given by Assemani in the Bibl. 
Orient., t. i., p. 608, we perceive that the 
Syriac copies of this work differ as much 
from one another as the Greek. 

On fol. 1 a there is a note stating that the 
manuscript belonged to one Simeon bar Had- 

be-shabba, from Salamya (rCjsAso , iuA-) :

On fol. 2 a there is a short index of lessons

written, but of about the same date. 

The writing on fol. 98 b is too much 
effaced to admit of decipherment.

letters, are 19 in number. Leaves are 
wanting after foil. 1 and 8. There are 
from 23 to 30 lines in each page. This 
volume is written in a good, regular hand, 
and dated A. Gr. 1240, A.D. 929. It con- 
tains — 

1. The Lives of the Egyptian Fathers by 
Palladius, or, as it is here called, " the work 
of Palladius on the profitable counsels of 
the holy Fathers," in a redaction different 
from that contained in Add. 12,173 (see 
Add. 17,264, fol. 65 b, and Add. 17,263). 
From the description given by Thomas

On fol. 93 a, after tlie doxology, once 
stood a note, of "which we can now read 
only the words : As^. r^^ rtf'i-n.i Jla 
T^x>.i yaCLis ^iM^.i . r^noAx^ . In its place 
has been substituted another, recording that 
this was one of the 250 voliunes brought to 
the convent of S. Mary Deipara by the abbat 
Moses of Nisibis, A. Gr. 124.3, A.D. 932. 

On fol. 94 a, which is much stained and 
torn, one Serguna has written his name:

The same page contains an ancient recipe 
for the manufacture of ink, in Arabic and 
Karshuni, probably of the ix* cent. The 
Arabic text runs as follows :

" Take f oz. of gaU-nut, pound it, and put 
it into a new pot. Pour on it a quart and a 
half of water, and boil it till one-third 
evaporates, then strain it through a coarse 
cloth, and put it again into the pot upon 
the fire. Take \ oz. of gum-arabic, and 
pound it till it becomes like dust. Let the 
water cool ; then take the gum-arabic and 
throw it into it by little and little. Take an 
ounce of copperas ; pound it very fine and 
throw it in. Then put it (the pot) on (the 

fire) again, till it (the water) (?). 

Then take it oflF, put it into a bottle, and let 
it stand for three days." 

The Karshuni text, which presents only a 
few trifling deviations from the above, runs 

thus : [.taJk'Ax .iCUMrdAre' \ -im\p^ cn.[.a^]

As mentioned above, foil. 44 and 45 are 
palimpsest. The older Syriac text is par- 
tially legible on fol. 44 b, and appears to be 
of the ix*" cent. At the foot of fol. 45 b 
stands the name of Bar-sauma, relsaa^-v=» , 
probably the person who inserted these two 
leaves.

DCCCCXLIL 

Vellum, about 10| in. by 6|, consisting of 
77 leaves (Add. 12,160, foU. 109—185). The 
quires were originally at least 15 in ntimber ; 
but r^,a, \ , M, \, t, and co* are entirely 
lost, and ^ is imperfect, a leaf being wanting 
after fol. 109, and another after fol. 116. 
They are signed with both letters and arith- 
metical figures, but a later hand has renum- 
bered them with letters only. Each page is 
divided into two columns, of from 25 to 33 
lines. The writing of the larger portion, 
foil. 109 — 152, is a fine, regular Estrangela 
of the latter half of the vi"" cent. ; the re- 
mainder, foil. 153 — 185, is neatly written in 
a more current hand of the vii"* cent. This 
manuscript contains — 
I. Lives of Saints ; viz . — 

1. The life of Abraham Kidunaya, .vsa 
f<luo:i.j.D )Benii>r<', ascribed to Ephraim (see 
Assemani, Bibl. Orient., t. i., pp. 38, 396 ; 
Ephraem Syri Opera, ed. Rom., t. ii., p. 1 ; 
Acta Sanctt. for March, t. ii., p. 436). Im- 
perfect. Fol. 109 a. 

2. The life of Jiilian Saba, or the Aged, 
r^lAcu r^iack^.! .cdclim^.i r«'^u&jL^ . Fol. 
117 a. It is also ascribed to Ephraim (see 
Assemani, Bibl. Orient., t. i., pp. 33, 154, 
397), but is in reality by Theodoret (see 
Opera, ed. Schulze, t. iii., p. 1119; Acta 
Sanctt. for October, t. viii., p. 353; and 



Add. 14,612, fol. 179 «, where this and the 
life of Jacob of Nisibis are expressly said to 
be taken from the Philotheus, .jaorc'ivLa). 

3. The history of the Man of God from the 
city of Eome (Alexius Romanus ; see Asse- 
mani, Bibl. Orient., t. i., p. 401, t. ii., pp. 
19, 285), who lived in the time of Rabulas,

the priest : r<lAa-A r^ \ -icL\.i r e* i »>j: i

134 b. Paul is said to have left his own 
city in Italy, rc^i\\ir^.i rc'^u^.-vso oocC^^ 
(fol. 135 6), and to have gone to Edessa, 
rd.o^H-&.i ,coior<', in the time of Rabulas 
(fol. 136 a). Of this latter city John was an 
inhabitant. 

5. The history of the Youths of Ephesus 
(the Seven Sleepers) : r<*i\\'i rc'i^o_L..ioso 
ojottL^r^-a.! . Fol. 147 a. The text com- 
mences with the passage corresponding to 
the Acta Sanctt. for July, t. vi., p. 394, 
paragraph 12. The youths are, however, 
said to be 8 in number (see Assemani, Bibl. 
Or., t. i., p. 335; Acta Sanctt., p. 376), fol.

* This seems to be the first of the " two very ancient 
Syriac manuscripts" which Assemani saw in the convent 
of S. Mary Deipara, and which he describes in the Bibl. 
Or., t. iii., pars i., p. 19. It appears to have been in 
much the same state then, A.D. 1715, as it is now.

Fol. 136 was once covered on both sides 
with writing, which has been almost wholly 
effaced. The recto now contains nothing 
but a few ornamental devices. On the verso 
there is a note of comparatively modern date, 
stating that a person, whose name has been 
rubbed out, read this book. He says that 
he was a native of Ras-'ain, from the con- 
vent of Mar Athanasius ; that his father's 
name was Severus bar Habib, and that his 
spiritual father was Anastasius, the librarian

Vellum, about 12 in. by 8|, consisting of 
33 leaves (Add. 12,142, foU. 74—107), the 
last of which is much soUed and torn. The 
quires are numbered with both letters and 
arithmetical figures (e. g., foil. 81, -^ ^^ ; 
93, en-. 2»™) ; the later numeration with 
letters is in part erroneous. Twelve quires 
and some leaves are wanting at the begin- 
ning, and at least several leaves at the end. 
Each page is divided into two columns, of 
from 23 to 27 lines. The writing is a fine, 
regular Estrangela of the vi''' cent. This 
manuscript contains — 

Acts of Martyrs ; viz. — 

1. The martyrdom of Cyprianus, Justa and 
Theoctistus, at Nicomedia, during the reign 
of Diocletian ; slightly imperfect at the com-

On fol. 1 a there is a note, in the usual 
form, stating that this was one of the 250 
volumes brought to the convent of S. Mary 
Deipara by the abbat Moses of Nisibis, 
A. Gr. 1243, A.D. 932. 

As mentioned above, this manuscript is 
palimpsest throughout. The ancient text 
is that of a manuscript of the Gospels, 
according to the Peshitta version, written in 
a fine, large Estrangela of the vi*** or vii"* 
cent. The quires are signed with letters; 
e. g. foU. 31 a, -\^, 181 a, ,s» . The Ammo- 
nian sections and Eusebian canons are 
marked on the margins, e. g. foil. 5 a, 48 a, 
143 a, 182 b ; and there was a harmony at the 
foot of each page, e. g. foil. 48 a, 88 a, 92 b, 
151 a. There were also rubrics indicating 
lessons for various occasions, e. g. foU. 3 a, 
6 6, 66 a, 143 a. Most of these things, 
however, being written with red paint, have 
either nearly or altogether disappeared. 
Fol. 112 b exhibits a Cross within an oval 
nimbus, which was probably once decorated 
with various colours. There is a similar 
Cross, but of smaller size, on fol. 216 a.

In some parts of this manuscript there are

A second note on fol. 178 a has been care-

Gabriel, and called rt*Ti n»;t r^Xjo^> ^1- 
412 a. Here Jacob left the others, and was 
led by the spirit to Tarsus, fol. 416 a. Hence 
he wandered, with a youth Antonius, to Amid 
(.•ViSorC), fol. 416 a, where he cured the son 
of the governor Anthimus (j»osa*Aur<'), a 
relative of the emperor Theodosius. Here 
he made the acquaintance of an abbat of 
Tur-Abdin named Bar-shabba (rdju-va), fol. 
417 a, who persuaded him to go with him to 
Hisn Kifii (re^artlsk.i r<lusu>), where Eufus 
(j»a_aoi), the brother of Anthimus, was 
governor. Having received the blessing of 
Sergius, the metropolitan, they departed, 
and travelled as far as a village called ^ 
re^aio^ , fol. 417 h, where they were joined 

OP 

by a youth named Hala (p^1*»), and where 
Antonius died suddenly. At another village 
they were hospitably received by a man 
named Habib (.-i i n»), whose son Daniel 
was cured by Jacob. Accompanied by this 
boy, they reached Hisn Kifa, where Benjamin 
was bishop. After residing here two months, 
they were captured by Shamir (visax.), the 
Persian general, and Bar-shabba suffered 
martyrdom, with ten of his disciples, fol. 
419 a. Immediately afterwards the Persian 
army was dispersed and destroyed by a hail- 
storm and earthquake, and the Persians 
never ventured to invade that district again. 
Jacob built here a small convent, which he 
called rc^Tt-iM.i i<''v*.i , or the Convent of the 
Recluse, fol. 420 a, and in it he continued to 
reside, attended by his disciple Daniel (for 
Hala resided in a convent of his own, fol. 
422 b), tm he died, on the 20* of Ilul, A. Gr.

105 leaves, some of which are slightly torn, 
especially foil. 2, 32—51, 69, 70, and 95—

probably belongs to the xiii"^ cent. It con-

Paper, about 19^ in. by 13|, consisting of 
227 leaves, many of which are much stained 
and torn, especiaUy foil. 1, 203—207, 209— 
211, and 213—227. The quires, signed with 
letters, must have been originally upwards 
of 30 in number (\^ , fol. 215 a), but those 
from .aA onwards are very imperfect. Leaves 
are wanting at the beginning, and after foil. 
59, 209, 211, 213, 214, 215, 221, 222, 223, 
and 226. Each page is divided into two 
columns, of from 30 to 47 lines. The writing 
is, for the most part, neat and regular, with 
numerous vowel points, and seems to be of 
the xiii* cent. ; but on fol. 1 a and foil. 217 
— 227 it is somewhat more recent. 

This volume originally contained 56 (eu) 
Histories of holy Men and Women and of 
Martyrs, to which were subsequently added 
14 others, making 70 (.j^) in all. Of these 
there now remain only 15 of the former, and

the note : .flooiaaOa^.T r^JE->.va.t r^h\ t \r h\ 

On fol. 227 b there is a mutilated note, 
written by one of the continuators of the 
volume, John of Sigistan. He requests the 
prayers of the fraternity for his brother 
Peter, and for Rabban 'Aziz, at whose 
expense that part of the book which con- 
tains the liistory of Pachomius was copied. 
The date is unfortunately obliterated, but 
from a subsequent passage we learn that 
Rabban Yeshua' was then abbat of the 
convent ofS. MaryDeipara. The conclusion 
of the note mentions the difficulty that was 
experienced in procuring a copy of the history 
of Pachomius in Syriac, the above mentioned 
Rabban 'Aziz having at last obtained it 
from the library of the church of S. Peter 

at Akka (Acre). p^mpC . > i V i » oAi>

with letters from .^ to .lUk ; but what the 
original signatures were, does not appear. 
The volume is imperfect both at the begin-

Two palimpsest leaves, much mutilated, 
from a Greek manuscript, written in slanting 
uncials of about the viii"* cent. They are 
part of a Vocabtilary or Glossary, letter O, 
but the order of the words is not strictly 
alphabetical. That portion, for example, of 
the first leaf, which is not rewritten, contains 

the words owxi^erai, ovaui, ovpayeui, Ofiov, <nrXo- 
fJMXM, ovap, ofi^pcx!, etc. 

The Syriac text is written in a small, neat 
hand of about the x*** cent. It is part of tlie 
martyrdom of Simeon bar Sabba'e and his 
companions. See Assemani, Acta Martt.,

DCCCCLXXXII. 

Vellum, about lOJ in. by 8|, consisting of 
86 leaves (Add. 14,4,84, foU. 48—133), a few 
of which are slightly stained and torn. The 
quires, 11 in number, seem to have been 
originally signed with arithmetical figures 
(see foil. 72 a, 94 o, and 102 a), but are 
now numbered with letters from .i* (fol. 
49 a) to eoA (fol. 127 a). Each page is 
divided into two columns, of from 22 to 
28 Unes. This manuscript is written in a 
fine Estrangela of the vi"' cent., and con- 
tains — 

1. The Acts of Simeon Stylites, coim^ 

rAiarS'.i rtlti ^^\*anT. tijss.l , compiled 

by his disciple Cosmas. Pol. 48 h. The 
text is substantially the same as that pub- 
lished by Assemani in the Acta SS. Mar-

ferences are very considerable. See Add.

Vellum, about 10| in. by 8, consisting of 
19 leaves (Add. 14,484, foil. 134 — 152), 
most of which are much stained and torn. 
The quires seem originally to have been 
signed with arithmetical figures (see fol. 
139 a). Leaves are wanting at the begin- 
ning, as well as after foil. 146, 150, and 151. 
Each page is divided into two columns, of 
from 25 to 28 lines. The writing is a fine, 
regular Estrangela of the vi"" cent. This 
manuscript contains — 

Portions of the Acts of Simeon Stylites, 

Pol. 152 was perhaps originally the last 
leaf of the preceding number. It contains a 
note, some portions of which have been 
intentionally effaced, informing us that this 
copy of the Acts of Simeon Stylites was 
presented to the church of that saint at 

by the deacon Simeon of the said 

church.

SCIENTIFIC LITERATURE. 



LOGIC AND EHETOEIC. 



DCCCCLXXXVII. 

Vellum, about 11^ in. by 7^, consisting of 
188 leaves, many of which, are much stained 
and some more or less torn, especially foil. 
1, 22, 31, 46, 49, 52, 53, 56, and 188. 
The quires, signed with letters, were origin- 
ally at least 22 in number ; but the first has 
been lost, and the next three are very 
imperfect. Leaves are now wanting at 
the beginning and end, as well as after foil. 
1, 7, 16, 17, 18, 19, 42, 46, 52, and 149. 
Each page is divided into two columns, of 
from 36 to 40 lines. This volume is written 
in a good, regular Estrangela of the vii"' 
cent. Greek vowels have been occasionally 
added by a later hand ( y -^ i o « ). Its 
contents are — 

1. A treatise on Logic by the archiater 
Sergius of Ras-'ain, probably identical with 
the r^<^aL\s9.i rdxix.ci&, mentioned by 'Ebed- 
Yeshua' in Assemani's Bibl. Or., t. iii., pars 
1, p. 87. It is dedicated to the author's 
friend Theodore, bishop of Maru or Merv 
(see Assemani, Bibl. Or., t. iii., pars 1, 



p. 147), and is divided into seven books or 
discourses, to each of which, except the last, 
a synoptical table of contents is appended. 
See Renan in the Journal Asiatique for 
1852, 4bhme Serie, t. xix., p. 320, and his 
treatise "de Philosophia Peripatetica apud 
Syros" (Paris, 1852), pp. 22, seqq.

DCCCCXCIY. 

Two vellum leaves, 6| in. by 5, written in 
a neat, regular hand of the ix"" cent., with 
20 or 21 lines in each page. They are frag- 
ments of a volume containing philosophical 
disquisitions, similar to those in the previous 
number. Porphyrins is cited, .itocuio^i^ . 

These two leaves are palimpsest. The 
more ancient text is written in double 
columns, in an elegant Estrangela of the 
vi"" cent. On the verso of the first leaf we 
find the commencement of a letter of Dios- 
corus to Domnus, bishop of Antioch, r^i^i\j<'

Paper, about 8^ in. by 7, consisting of 
231 leaves, some of which are slightly 
stained and soiled, especially fol. 2. The 
qmres, signed with letters (by a later hand), 
are 23 in number. There are from 22 to 31 
lines in each page. This volume is written 
in a good, regular hand of about the xiii*^ 
cent., with numerous Greek and Syriac 
vowels and other points. A few leaves are 
more modem, apparently of the -xvi"' cent., 
viz. foU. 2 — 9, 18, 80 — 87, 230, and 231.

Scientific Dialogues, o_\o»Xr£L..i . The 
name of the author does not seem to be 
mentioned, unless perhaps in the title, fol. 
2 b, which has been almost wholly effaced, 
partly, as it would appear, on purpose. 
According to a manuscript in the University 
Library of Berlin, the author's name is Jacob 
bar oftAx., or bar 'Isa (r^aai;:^. , (\tn\ ), bishop 
of Tagrit. . See Assemani, Bibl. Or., t. ii., 
pp. 237, seqq., and particularly p. 455. The 
work is divided into two books, the first 
containing four dialogues and a discourse, 
the second two dialogues.

have been Phil(oxenus). See fol. 82 a,

On fol. 230 b there is a note, stating that 
the book once belonged to the metropolitan 
Dioscorus, who had it by inheritance from 
the patriarch John ; but that it had been 
exchanged with the monk Rabban [Isaiah, 
the son of the priest Moses,*] of the village 
of , for a medical work in Arabic, 

entitled J^sJi \ j^^fS . This note was written 

by one Timothy, who bound and repaired 

the book, A. Gr. 1878, A.D. 1567.

DCCCCXCVI. 

Two vellum leaves, about 8f in, by 6|, 
written in double columns of from 34 to 36 
lines, in a neat, regular hand of the ix"" or 
x'l' cent. (Add. 17,217, foil. 37, 38). As 
they had been washed and prepared as 
palimpsest, the original writing was almost 
illegible, until revived by the careful appli- 
cation of chemical reagents. They con-

Portions of the rdLLsa.99 ^io^ , or Syriac 
Grammar, of Jacob of Edessa,* in which he 
explained and applied his new system of 
vowel-pointing to the Syriac language. 

The oldest system of vowel-punctuation 
used by the Syrians was that by means of 
small points or dots above and below the 



• On Jacob of Edessa, as grammarian, see, in particu- 
lar, " Jacques d' Edesse et les Voyelles Syriennes," by 
M. I'Abbe Martin, in the Journal Asiatique for Mai- 
Juin 1869, p. 447; "Jacobi Ep* Edesseni Epistola ad 
Georgium Ep™ Sarugensem" etc., ed. Martin, 1869; 
and "A Letter by Mar Jacob, bishop of Edessa, on 
Syriac Orthography," etc., edited by Dr. PhiUips, 1869. 



consonants ((V, fV, etc.), which has been 
retained by the Nestorians. Subsequently, 
about the time of Jacob of Edessa, the 
Greek vowels were introduced in the same 

V o 

positions (rs* or rtf", re* or p<', etc.) — whether 

by himself or by others, is not perfectly 
clear, — and were gradually extensively 
adopted by the Jacobites, The earliest 
examples of their use in the Nitrian manu- 
scripts are in Add. 17,134, fol. 83 (dating 
from about A,D. 675, and perhaps autograph 
of Jacob, see above, no. CCCCXXI.), and 
Add. 14,429 (dated A.D. 719, see above, no. 
LX.). 

Jacob planned, however, a farther refor- 
mation, viz. the introduction of a series of 
vowel-signs which could be written, like the 
Greek vowels, on a level with and between 
the consonants ; and it was partly with the 
view of recommending this system to his 
countrymen that he composed the ^io^

This book once belonged to a Jew, who 
has occasionally written words on the mar-

8 a and b, 13 a, 21 b, 22 a, etc. Another 
owner, the deacon Ibrahim, jor^sa—x. 
)a*enr^i3r<', has recorded his name on fol. 
100 b. Subsequently it became the property 
of Dr. Adam Clarke. See the Catalogue of
